He wakes to find himself a thousand years in the future, in a space station on the far side of the sun. Or so he is told by the mysterious, sexless human who greets him. Madoc assures himself that he's still in his own time, trapped in advanced virtual reality by one of his foes, because if he isn't, he has no idea why he was cryogenically frozen--which would mean that he was a dangerous criminal. And he doesn't remember that either! Plus, the notorious serial killer Christine Caine has been defrosted to join him, and they, along with their strange rescuer, have just been captured in an impossible space battle by an unknown enemy.The Omega Expeditionis the sixth and concluding volume of Brian Stableford's grand future history, which explores the possibilities and perils of emortality  (near-immortality). This is one of the most thoughtful, complex, and ambitious series ever produced in science fiction, and its final novel, a standalone work, masterfully orchestrates the numerous characters, themes, plot lines, and ideas to a bold conclusion. But newcomers to the series really shouldn't start withThe Omega Expedition. Read the novels of this future history in the author's intended order, detailed in his informative introduction toThe Omega Expedition.

Though she's comfortably settled in her hometown of Revere, Mass., and relishing the affections of Matt Gennaro, a local homicide detective with &#x22;Al Pacino eyes,&#x22; Gloria can't seem to keep her nose out of sleuthing. When John Galigani, the son of her beloved landlords, is accused of murdering a former girlfriend, Yolanda Fiore, Gloria's on the case to prove John's innocence faster than you can say &#x22;periodic table.&#x22; Although Matt has to recuse himself because of his friendship with the Galigani family, he helps sift through clues and Lamerino's hypotheses. Was Yolanda killed because her newsletter Raid-iation exposed falsified data in Japan? Did her death stem from conflict over a questionable library expansion plan? Or did Yolanda uncover clues about a 55-year-old murder? Descriptions of boron as a neutron poison, radioactive wastes, Italian food and characters' fashion choices serve more often to slow than advance the plot. In addition, readers may find themselves lost amid generations of Italian names in this highly populated novel. Reading Yolanda's e-mails, Lamerino decides, must be like wading through something by Mario Puzo. But there's no denying the flair in Minichino's portrait of Italian Americans, or the charm of her energetic, quick-thinking heroine, who seeks both love and justice.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.","price":{"$numberDouble":"2.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OegmTVR6L._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B0055DLB6E","B0065TFUB4","B00E6BRO3K","B0076R85RK","B001QBPMGO","B0037262EG","B0051GA620","B00BC255W8","B005GSYY7G","B0095ZMIEM","B00J1VHDOA","B00JCCKRSW","B00KLBZQCA","B00J5PNN1O","B007VSDH0O","B00JLJFJ4S","B00KB58WQ8","B00G3L6M0C","B00GSBEDI0","B0030CVR1G","B001QNVPOK","B0012DHDRM","B003A83WCM","B002N83H3E","B0017SYO5G","B00G3L13KQ","B00EOAS0DQ","B00KYF3DUK","B00H6EOJNW","B00L16JGCU","B00KFRH6U0","B00I3N5QT6","B00IRNK2M8","B00ILBRNXC","B00EOARZ3M","B00JXQX24S","B00BDQ39O4","B00K8EPP0S","B00HDMMF56","B00G3L7Z6C","B00ISEOIMG","B00FQLYIYW","B00DIGWALK","B00HSD3I7Y","B00JJXUZH2","B0051GAVCA","B00JJXTOUG","B00K1CKJ3U","B00ISEOMQS","B00BTRDIWU","B0064W5DX2","B00EOARZMI","B00FFFN7UK","B00FX7LUWM","B00EOARZFU","B00HMXLQXS","B0095ZMFW2","B00J6GUFI6","B00DYX9M8Q","B00HGUQDEO","B00CX5V59U","B00IDHUZCA","B00JDQI8AQ","B00BC24M22","B00GKPXU3S","B00DYX9KJ2","B00HDMM8DU","B003P9XMA8","B00IRCZIPA","B00A6WV6S2","B00BSAZ4S4","B00DYX9NLC","B00IEIIOCG","B00F2X0PJG","B008JHXQVG","B009YAVVAU","B00JMJJWXQ","B00JCZRBX8","B00A37X8EK","B005GSYYZS","B006U1C6D2","B003OYIAA6","B00IZ0ZY9E","B00H6EJQQM","B00DYX9K8I","B00D7Z4GIC","B00F9F0UV0","B00G1G2942","B006U1C0V0","B00FIMZ08C","B00K0E3YQI","B00I6T4NRI","B00CC126O8","B003K154TS","B00FX7LVE4","B00F9EZBG0","B009RYL1US","B00AY48QUS","B00IPOPJOU","B00HDMMFUQ"],"buy_after_viewing":["B0076R85RK","B00H2862YG","B00E6BRO3K","B0051GA620"]},"categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction","United States"],["Books","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Mystery","Women Sleuths"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Mystery","Series"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Mystery","Women Sleuths"]],"author":null,"title":null,"genres":["Series","United States","Literature & Fiction","Mystery","Women Sleuths","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense"]}

GA is also the only segment that does not emphasize being &#x22;in command.&#x22; Instead, GA training has traditionally focused on rote execution of flight maneuvers. New studies reveal a proactive approach to general aviation flight operations successfully improves general aviation accident odds. Based on FAA-mandated pilot-in-command authority and responsibility for flight safety and operations, Pilots in Command: Strategic Action Plan for Reducing &#x22;Pilot Error&#x22; provides private pilots a how-to guide to cockpit decision making. Using a step-by-step model, pilots discover how to use available tools to avoid pilot error. The book also identifies inherent pilot habits commonly practiced by general aviation pilots and presents methods for self-retraining to eliminate the problematic behaviors. General Aviation training is changing to meet the facts of rising accident trends and subsequent investigation into its origins and prevention.

The &#x22;fey&#x22; Nuala (last seen in 2001's Irish Love) senses that self-made Chicago lawyer and tough guy Seamus Costelloe is doomed after meeting him at a Milan music festival. Nuala persuades her beloved husband, Dermot, that they must find out why in time to prevent tragedy. Back in the Windy City, Dermot pursues the true cause of the century-old Haymarket Riot, while Nuala gives premature birth to their latest angel, Socra Marie, who has to spend several weeks in the neonatal ICU. Dermot does much of the legwork as Nuala recuperates and focuses on the baby, though her maternal duties don't stop her from running the show. The immigrant condition is very much on their minds, in both past and present investigations, and even life at home is affected by the hardships and prejudices encountered by new arrivals, especially in ethnically complex Chicago. There's a lot to keep straight in this one. When he isn't trying to help Nuala save Costelloe, Dermot is reading transcripts of the Haymarket trial and period newspaper articles, especially those penned by journalist Ned Fitzpatrick, who reported on the riot and its aftermath. Portions of Ned's diary, set in italic, can be slow going. Greeley lays the Irish on a bit thick for some tastes, but the double plot is rich with detail, while the couple's earnestness and good intentions are never in question.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecac2b19a853d963612"},"asin":"B000FA5TOM","description":"Though questions linger about just how much Robbins (1916-1997) contributed to the later books published under his name, this posthumous novel moves quickly and is great fun, a roman &#x85; clef reminiscent of his early bestselling bildungsromans Never Love a Stranger (1948) and A Stone for Danny Fisher (1952). Packed with vintage Robbins boudoir scenes, it follows a street-smart youth clawing and copulating his way to wealth and power. Born Howard Hughes Jr., the bastard son of the famous multimillionaire recluse, Zack Riordan comes to Vegas in 1966 at age 12, and 12 years later has become the youngest casino security chief on the Strip. The narrative follows Zack's career as he gets involved in a vicious rivalry with the wastrel son and snooty Vassar-educated daughter of his mentor, Con Halliday, the aging owner of the casino Zack has helped save from ruin. When Zack is unceremoniously fired, he crosses continents to cut deals with Chinese criminal elements in Hong Kong and to parlay his quick wits and daring into enough money to finance his own casino, unwinding from hard days of sordid financial exploits by bedding one beautiful woman after another. Returning home, Zack discovers that he has a son by his former mentor's daughter, and finds himself wondering if he has paid too high a price for wealth and power. Those Robbins fans who haven't already fallen by the wayside will be rewarded for their devotion with this unexpectedly lively offering.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.","price":{"$numberDouble":"7.59"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515SsOlJQxL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B00AJGNIT0","B00AJGNIL8","B00AJGNIYA","B007USA76C","B00AJGNJ30","B007US2XBY","B00545H3WY","B00AJGNJ4E","B00AJGNJ8K","B000TWUTSW","B00AJGNIPO","B006M40WH4","B00KDNH1XS","B00AJGNIMM","B00AJGNINQ","B00AJGNGRY","B00AJGNGRE","B00KDNHQ5Q","B00KDNO69U","B00FO6QG1W","B00KDNHGYM","B00I4X9H90","B00KDNHVBA","B00C6OD1CW","B00CAXBD9C","B00KDNHITK","B00KDNH3R2","B00I39NOT4","B00F0NJHNS","B0081V4QRI","B0081V4QH8","B00KDNHZ3O","B00KDNHR3C","B00H4GC7PY","B00KDNHD0Y","B009OR5NO8","B00H8ZTKO2","B00KDNHJL2","B00KDNGZ6W","B003P2VZH2","B0015DWIWY","B00IOBXCLQ","B007SYF114","B003P2WBLQ","B00KDNHG92","B007W7DE70","B003CIOQ02","B00KDNGYKY","B00KDNHUFM","B003JBHVG8","B007SPE0KG","B000Q80SP8","B003P2W4UO","B003GYEH4W","B008BU70AO","B003P2VZHM","B003QP4BJW","B00GPDYNPE","B000FBJHO4","B000FC0R10","B003P2VZGI","B00KAZZ1VS","B005UD1G2I","B00IRDI05Y","B004H1TC3Y","B007Z58ZRI","B00KGR2IU2","B00IB85Z3U","B000VY4ZBK","B000FC2916","B00HZWY750","B003JBHVIQ","B003P2VNXS","B003LL2YRW","B007SRR43O","B002IPZDUM","B00BKFX7TA","B0045U9WQO","B003P2W3PA","B003M69P9G","B00BQMLIBG","B00AMNKBLI"],"buy_after_viewing":["B00AJGNIL8","B000TWUTSW","B00KDNHVBA","B00H4GC7PY"]},"categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction","Contemporary"],["Books","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Thrillers & Suspense","Suspense"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Contemporary Fiction"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Suspense"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Thrillers"]],"author":null,"title":null,"genres":["Suspense","Thrillers","Thrillers & Suspense","Contemporary Fiction","Contemporary","Literature & Fiction","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense"]}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecac2b19a853d963637"},"asin":"B000FBFCCA","description":"Although 91 years old, Deng Xiaoping is still believed to be the most powerful leader in China. Widely considered responsible for China's rapid economic growth, political reform, and open-door policy since the late Seventies, he is also linked to the Tiananmen Massacre in Beijing in June 1993. He thus represents a paradox, an enigma to the outside world. Goodman's political biography gives a detailed explanation of the relationship between these two images. Deng is characterized as a &#x22;committed communist&#x22; with a pragmatic view, who would like to bring forth China's modernization through the &#x22;organizational&#x22; rather than &#x22;ideological&#x22; leadership of the Communist party.

Begun in the 1950s by young, Harlem-born Holcombe Rucker, the tournaments included some of basketball's great games throughout the decades. Here, such pros as Julius Erving, Wilt Chamberlain and, more recently, Kobe Bryant pounded the asphalt with local unknowns. Mallozzi, who grew up and played basketball nearby in the 1970s and 80s, has covered the tournament since 1986: &#x22;nowhere else could I find the kind of basketball that was being played at Rucker Park, where legends, nicknames, and great rivalries are born every summer.&#x22; While he celebrates the tournament's past glory (Rucker died of cancer in 1965 at the age of 38), he doesn't shy away from its sometimes controversial moments (many people think it's become simply a hip-hop show and shoe ad, where the game is hardly taken seriously).

Naturally, there are those who yearn for pregnancy the old-fashioned, &#x22;Abnormal&#x22; way. Neiderman's fast-moving tale weaves together several such characters, but focuses on Natalie Ross, a romance novelist who was born an Abnormal. Despite her best efforts at using black-market birth control, Natalie finds herself pregnant-which could ruin her lawyer husband. Even more intriguing is a story line involving a group of young girls who are infatuated with the idea of pregnancy; at meetings of their clandestine PYPC (Pretend You're Pregnant Club), they stuff pillows under their shirts and commune on prenatal vitamins. One Machiavellian girl, hyper-sexualized and fascinated by the violence of animals, resorts to murder when threatened with exposure. The ideas that comprise the bulk of this book aren't novel-laboratory births and fascist family planning having been a sci-fi staple for decades-but Neiderman's light touch and breezy style make this well-worn idea seem new again.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.","author":null,"title":null,"genres":["Suspense","Genetic Engineering","Science Fiction","Thrillers","Thrillers & Suspense","Contemporary Fiction","Science Fiction & Fantasy","Technothrillers","Contemporary","Literature & Fiction","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense"]}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecac2b19a853d963658"},"asin":"B000FBJEHE","description":"In this languidly paced historical set in 1840, Selena Cott is a young astronomer on a mission: to be the first scientist, man or woman, to photograph (or rather daguerreotype) a total solar eclipse. She joins an expedition setting out along the Santa Fe Trail, its stated purpose to prove that the eccentric genius Charles Babbage's &#x22;difference engine,&#x22; a mechanical computer prototype, can reliably calculate the exact latitude of an eclipse. Selena is an American, but she was raised a tomboy in France by her sea captain father, and she brings to her frontier adventure a cultured European manner coupled with progressive attitudes about a woman's place in the world. This sets her at odds with the chauvinistic explorers on the expedition, chief among them William Henshaw Pryce, Charles Babbage's financial adviser. Pryce has a secret (and nefarious) plan to locate the remains of Babbage's fabulously wealthy great uncle Richard and claim the inheritance that remains intestate in England years after the old geezer's disappearance in America. Selena braves desert rigors, the condescension and perfidy of her colleagues, and savage Native Americans in her race toward the first scientifically recorded total eclipse in the American Southwest. While Byrd tacks on a mystery and thriller subplot at the end to create a semblance of tension, the book is mostly an engaging travelogue along the old Santa Fe Trail, served up with plenty of authentic frontier detail and enough lessons in early 19th-century navigation to satisfy the most clueless bushwhacker as to his or her exact longitude and latitude.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Major Yanaba Maddock, medically retired with severely damaged lungs after military action aboard a space station, is pressured into acting as a spy by her employer, the sinister Intergal corporation. Colonel Giancarlo, local head of psychological operations, seeks evidence that colonists on the bitterly cold and inhospitable planet Petaybee are abducting company geological survey teams, engaging in illegal genetic engineering and plotting rebellion. Yana finds the locals charming, helpful and uncannily effective as healers; their home remedies salvage her ruined lungs. As the company and its forces move in to quell what they perceive as rebellion, Yana casts her lot with the Petaybeans and geneticist Sean Shongili, the man she has come to love. Perceptive characterizations and a vivid depiction of a nurturing culture integrated with nature make up for the somewhat hackneyed plot.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.","price":{"$numberDouble":"9.95"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Nq65ih0zL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B000QCQ98Y","B000FBFM8E","B000FCKKSK","B000MAHBYG","B000XPNWCA","B000FC1HIM","B000FBFM8O","B000FBJAKU","B000FC1JW6","B00CHQOVUU","B000FBJD3O","B003JBI43W","B000FBJELA","B002XHNOMO","B000FBFM2A","B000JMKNVU","B000FCKBFW","B000FCKBFC","B003WUYOPC","B000UKON62","B000FCKBG6","B00AP9CX9W","B00CDUVSL0","B001UFP4TG","B000FCKBIY","B00CHIA9BS","B00CDUVSVU","B000FC1I8G","B000FCKBFM","B000FCKBHA","B00AP9XOT0","B00CDUVSIS","B000FCKBGQ","B000FCKBH0","B000FBFM34","B00APA4NJY","B00APACHTW","B00CX93DSC","B000FBFOSC","B00JOOQHH8","B000FBFOQ4","B00APA1JK0","B00APAEX4O","B000FBFOKA","B000FC1I9A","B00JOOQE12","B00JOOQHVE","B00B1EJLRW","B000FBFODC","B000FBFOK0","B000FC1KGQ","B000FBFOPK","B000W93AEM","B000FBFODM","B000FBFM2U","B005OCYQW2","B0036S4CAC","B00JOOQE1M","B000FBJDVQ","B000FBFOPU","B000JMKNK6","B0015DWLW6","B004J4WKB0","B000FBFODW","B00IXX4IZE","B000RH0E70","B000FC2RO0","B0075YJEG0","B0067AN1YO","B00INIYFWK","B00DMCPROM","B005Z3NOKK","B00IJMIFE4","B000FBFOD2","B002SV371I","B002J05GK8","B004FPYZ8Y","B002IPZC26","B002HUU056","B0017T09XG","B00HXZZXV6","B000FBFOCS","B00LMMLQU8","B004G8Q182","B002IPZJ6U","B002IEUV4G","B002J05GLC","B002J05GJY","B000FBFOCI","B004G8PYJE","B002J05GVM","B00AP9XR7Y","B002WPFHAE","B00BEQZMH0","B00CLFCFVY","B002I1XS3A","B002J05GYO","B0040SYIZG","B002IEUV7I","B002J05H16"],"buy_after_viewing":["B000FCKBFW","B000RH0E70","B000FC1HIM","B000FBFM34"]},"categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction"],["Books","Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],["Books","Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science Fiction","Adventure"],["Books","Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science Fiction","Space Opera"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science Fiction","Adventure"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science Fiction","Space Opera"]],"author":"Anne Mccaffrey","title":"Powers That Be (Petaybee Trilogy Book 1)","genres":["Science Fiction","Fantasy","Science Fiction & Fantasy","Adventure","Literature & Fiction","Space Opera"]}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecac2b19a853d963667"},"asin":"B000FBJGQ8","description":"Two of the best mystery writers in America team up in this interestingLaw and Order-type experiment. In the first half of the book, a sexually  voracious architect prowls the dark corners of New York looking for some action  before he heads back to his frigid L.A. wife. In the second half, a prostitute's  grisly rape-murder engages the attention of the guys (and girl) in blue. What's  the connection between the murdered woman and the obsession-ridden architect? A  string of coincidences that make the reader expect a surprise ending, of course.  But it doesn't happen, which makes one wonder why the two authors (who happen to  be the same person) bothered with the gimmick. Still, both Ed McBain (author of  the 87th Precinct novels) and Evan Hunter (his more literary and much sexier  incarnation) are old pros, so the pacing, character development, and thorough  knowledge of police procedure and human nature that mark this tidy little  mystery make it a pleasant enough diversion. A new McBain or Hunter is always  cause for celebration, andCandyland, which is a lot grittier than most  police procedurals, will titillate their many fans until either (or both) comes  through with a new thriller. The distinct narrative voices of the multitalented  writer are on view here; although the writing styles aren't different enough to  make it more than a parlor trick, the result is still twice as good as most of  the season's new offerings.--Jane Adams","price":{"$numberDouble":"15.95"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dNVDskwnL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B000FC2RTA","B00FT5ILZC","B00FT5ILIE","B0055UZPU0","B00FT5ILMU","B005WZZUKI","B003KGAZVK","B000FC0Y8Q","B000FC1V7E","B00FT5ILM0","B00287KD8W","B000FC0RWE","B005WZZSL4","B005WZZS7I","B00287KCZG","B005WZZUR6","B003XRELJI","B005WZZQ52","B000FC0QSY","B00FT5ILKC","B005WZZSZK","B005WZZQWK","B005WZZSGY","B005WZZTB8","B000FC0OBS","B005WZZUBC","B00558UVJW","B005WZZQKW","B005WZZS0K","B005WZZRB0","B00558UVQK","B000FC0RVU","B005WZZQB6","B005WZZR42","B005WZZTIG","B005WZZTEK","B005WZZUDU","B005WZZTRM","B005WZZUHG","B005WZZUUS","B00558UVMO","B007MDDD52","B005WZZU0I","B005WZZU8U","B005WZZTM2","B005WZZTPO","B005WZZQHA","B005WZZU3U","B005WZZRDI","B005WZZSPK","B005WZZTX6","B005WZZRIS","B005WZZT54","B005WZZRWY","B005WZZSUU","B000SIZG8A","B005WZZR9M","B005WZZRQU","B005WZZQNO","B00558UVNI","B003L786LY","B005WZZRZQ","B005WZZR1A","B003T0GBPQ","B00558UVJ2","B00558UVQ0","B0028MVHDM","B00766ZVIM","B000FC10SY","B00GDMB684","B005WZZQS4","B00GWOF83W","B00C5R7I9C","B0054TVW6I","B009A9LL6O","B0089OEI9I","B000QCSA4K","B007TN3Q8E","B007TN3P6M","B005410R3K","B0068ZYJYY","B003P9XHNU","B003E74AKM","B000FC140I","B003HKR18Y","B00486U8Q8","B0046LV0IU","B000GCFXAO","B005410RMQ","B005F4AU7O","B00B3GLRGG","B005F4CCTI","B005F48CDS","B002SVQD2S","B004IATCES","B002TXZS5S","B003GK21GC","B0042JSSSG","B005F4CDCO","B00B4V7RHI"],"buy_after_viewing":["B005WZZTPO","B005WZZQ52","B0055UZPU0","B005WZZSL4"]},"categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction","Contemporary"],["Books","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Mystery","Police Procedurals"],["Books","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Thrillers & Suspense","Psychological Thrillers"],["Books","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Thrillers & Suspense","Suspense"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Contemporary Fiction"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Mystery","Police Procedurals"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Suspense"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Thrillers","Psychological"]],"author":null,"title":null,"genres":["Suspense","Police Procedurals","Thrillers & Suspense","Contemporary Fiction","Thrillers","Psychological","Contemporary","Literature & Fiction","Psychological Thrillers","Mystery","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense"]}

Proceeding from a brilliant New Yorker essay (&#x22;My Grandmother's House&#x22;) about a childhood dominated and emblematized by a powerful and mysterious matriarch and her old-fashioned house, Gordon tracks her progress outward to the grand Manhattan spaces that were her refuge as a student at Barnard, to a beloved writer's retreat on Cape Cod, then to her return to the apartment of her girlhood dreams as a Barnard professor. Not surprisingly, the writing anchored in childhood is the strongest; there, Gordon conveys a sadness and solitude that is a kind of fertile darkness. Nurtured by her Catholic- and Hollywood-themed fantasies, &#x22;trying to construct a world of lightness,&#x22; she nonetheless practiced a ruthless honesty that, she notes, serves her well as a writer. The child of a gentle failure, a writer of unpublishable pieces, and of a proud, polio-crippled working mother, Gordon was forced to move in with her grandmother after the death of her father. There, she marinated in the shadows, seeing but seemingly unseen, making observations shot through with longing and wit. An immaculate young priest entered the darkly feminine house, making the girl feel &#x22;a lightening of the atmosphere that made me think there was some hope for my future life.&#x22; The later essays are often sketchy and self-indulgent, as when she ruminates about her good fortune in landing again at Barnard.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecac2b19a853d96367a"},"asin":"B000FC0OFY","description":"Ernest Hemingway did more to change the style of English prose than any other writer of his time. Publication of The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms immediately established Hemingway as one of the greatest literary lights of the twentieth century. As part of the expatriate community in 1920s Paris, the former journalist and World War I ambulance driver began a career that led to international fame. Hemingway was an aficionado of bullfighting and big-game hunting, and his main protagonists were always men and women of courage and conviction who suffered unseen scars, both physical and emotional.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecac2b19a853d963686"},"asin":"B000FC0VS4","description":"The ad copy on the back of the proofs for Pyper's second novel (after Lost Girls) points out just what's right, and what's wrong, with the book: &#x22;The Trade Mission is a gripping, ingeniously plotted thriller with an underlying literary interest in social criticism....&#x22; The novel does grip, and while its plot-two young North American software entrepreneurs and their colleagues visiting Brazil are kidnapped by extortionists in the jungle, then escape for a chase-isn't quite ingenious, it's clever enough; so far so good. The problem is the &#x22;underlying literary interest in social criticism.&#x22; One supposes the copywriter mentioned &#x22;literary&#x22; as a pointer to Pyper's prose, which is lush and suffused with psychological insight, but which too often draws attention to itself at the expense of the story. The &#x22;social criticism&#x22; is relayed through character studies-the kidnapped are extremely complex creations, as is their Canadian translator, a woman rapidly approaching middle age, who narrates; her probings into the differences rendered by wealth, class and age among the kidnapped, and between them and their captors, are perceptive and fresh. The novel takes a serious wrong turn, though, when the kidnapped are harbored by a tribe of Yanomami Indians. While giving the narrator plenty of chance to comment on the degradation of the rain forest and its peoples by industrial interests, this turn feels contrived; it leads to the kidnapped ingesting a native hallucinogen, which exacerbates the murkiness of the narrator's perceptions and results in a storytelling muddle that Pyper straightens out only through further contrivances. Pyper is a talented stylist and a masterful psychological portraitist, but his new novel is a slog.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.","price":{"$numberDouble":"9.73"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Bk3n83gtL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B004EBT6XS","B008J4TDSO","B00EMDQ06E","B00KRPQ2L4","B00HXYKZ56","B00HWGLWUM","B00AR2RZ3Q","B00KOTXH8Y","B00INIXS96","B00B6U09Y0","B00BCPEWT2","B00G3L6KF4","B00H87RLJQ","B00IHCYW16","B009NF6Z2K","B009LRWU74","B00FPQCWR8","B00GVZV818","B007L24U4M","B009VMC0FG","B003OYICSQ","B004UNDA2I","B004WDZZNI","B00GRJ2BAU","B00FPQA76Q","B009CL2G9G","B004BDP08Y","B000NY11MO","B0089LOG2A","B007HB5S1Q","B00ERTDIWM","B002OK2OKS","B00AR04IJM","B008RLW9FS","B00AEBEUH4","B0091WP5BM","B001JEPKX8","B00EGMHJSE","B00EXTQSE6","B00HJJGKG8","B001JJWI56","B006X1IS0E","B006LFO1DA","B00FUZPC4O","B009VMB7FA","B00AOBMGN4","B00E2RYUAS","B009Y4I992","B006FOIH6E","B004SI9AU6","B00DGZL33Y","B00DPM7Y9A","B00BNPI7P6","B003FCVEY6","B009CBNITI","B00CCX9DNI","B004TC14OG","B00DEPSHUI","B0074VTHMK","B002OTKEKQ","B008LQ1TW8","B003UYURI8","B00ANW13U6","B004INHD9Q","B009SAV110"],"buy_after_viewing":["B008J4TDSO","B004EBT6XS","B00EMDQ06E","B009NF6Z2K"]},"categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction","Contemporary"],["Books","Literature & Fiction","Literary"],["Books","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Thrillers & Suspense","Psychological Thrillers"],["Books","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Thrillers & Suspense","Suspense"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Contemporary Fiction"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Literary Fiction","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Literary Fiction","Psychological"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Suspense"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Thrillers","Psychological"]],"author":null,"title":null,"genres":["Suspense","Literary","Thrillers","Thrillers & Suspense","Contemporary Fiction","Psychological","Contemporary","Literary Fiction","Literature & Fiction","Psychological Thrillers","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense"]}

He discusses what women might unconsciously do to trigger those feelings, including over-estimate their man's strength and fortitude, or compare him to other men. Men, Weinberg maintains, have four basic needs: to feel special, to &#x22;travel light,&#x22; to know their partners are loyal and to &#x22;be close emotionally.&#x22; Explaining how that last need is true in the face of so much evidence to the contrary is one of the main tasks of the book, one that Weinberg carries out carefully and without condescension. But the implications of this theory of &#x22;gut reactions&#x22; that must be managed has consequences: because men are actually the &#x22;weaker sex,&#x22; the job of seeing through a man's &#x22;Masculine Pretense&#x22; and acting accordingly-at least with men who are not in therapy with Weinberg-falls to women, who must be willing to accept that role. Weinberg necessarily paints men in broad strokes-surely not every man equates earning power with virility-but for women who can see the individual beneath the stereotype and who don't mind being the minder of the relationship, this book offers concrete advice.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.","price":{"$numberDouble":"9.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xVr-8UrjL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B009P7PY6Y","B006VOMKV6","B009SQ1R9U","B00B9A3SRM","B00C833IPQ","B0029DOLJ2","B00BGPRRGI","B00JSVTQPW","B00F2IIVVK","B00G8L39J4","B00CNYVIF2","B00C7VJ1KA","B008XT8KHA","B00DFUFD2C","B00FTEVILM","B00HWIBM3W","B00CEZ8TPM","B009J2KFGO","B005WJGPZI","B00CNHJMG6","B000ZXHPSW","B00A3XW4FI","B00B9E4Y30","B007XKFGS6","B000GCFY2G","B00F27ARL8","B00887JUQC","B008CGUFB8","B00CZTE5C8","B008DXAZ60","B00IK2YA0Q","B00I1M4LIG","B00DMN14UW","B005T0YIHC","B009D0JLT4","B00EOY2UJW","B00DB53ZMQ","B009ZKMN74","B00AQZ76N8","B007MW2TLC","B006WCRBW0","B00GKTW9ZO","B000QCQ9PC","B00AHGDQG2","B00BRJULUM","B001Y35G9M","B005HAS3HA","B004QZ9RSG","B006KIXUXK","B00DNCPDYA","B003GAMXG0","B0047O2HVK","B00F0WXIG6","B00BEA1ARW","B00KLIPCAY","B0085YBTEO","B009KSCCCC","B00EBY8KXA","B0082J7SI8","B0040ZNSQY","B00BC2I8JA","B006JD1OXE","B00HYF4MWQ","B00AGKV59Y","B00CP7YA5C","B00B3V6UXG","B00CIJ080I","B0081LHZC6","B00I2FHHG0","B003DYGNJM","B00E98A5IG","B003YL44FY","B009R9ICVO","B006B7LT1U","B000FCKDIW","B001CN48VQ","B00742WT1U","B00G1508QO","B0078GU1EO","B009GKXRGY","B0049H9AVU","B00ERIQ6XG","B004DNWBV6","B004VB8RW2","B005307MMQ","B00BN3L3G8","B001NLL89M","B001HC8516","B00ECG0P0I","B002EBDPJG","B000PC71OG","B00D7MP5FI","B00ASDRZMU"],"buy_after_viewing":["B007XKFGS6","B00BGPRRGI","B00887JUQC","B006VOMKV6"]},"categories":[["Books","Parenting & Relationships"],["Books","Self-Help","Relationships","Love & Romance"],["Books","Self-Help","Relationships","Marriage"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Health, Fitness & Dieting","Relationships","Love & Romance"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Health, Fitness & Dieting","Relationships","Marriage"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Parenting & Relationships"]],"author":"George Weinberg Ph.D.","title":"Why Men Won't Commit: Getting What You Both Want Without Playing Games","genres":["Parenting & Relationships","Relationships","Health, Fitness & Dieting","Love & Romance","Marriage","Self-Help"]}

Druett reaches far back in history, opening her lively book with an account of the water-coursing Massegetae queen Tomyris, who bested the Persian king Cyrus on the shores of the Volga River. Druett enlists dozens of other militarily, criminally, and commercially extraordinary women in her dramatis personae, including the Egyptian pharaoh Cleopatra, whose name is synonymous with mysterious beauty but who also commanded a mighty navy; Cheng I Sao, the 18th-century terror of the South China Sea; and Lucy Brewer, who, disguised as a man, served as a common sailor aboard the U.S.S.Constitution. Along the way Druett considers the role of New England women as financial mainstays of the whaling trade, stops at Spanish ports of call controlled by powerful (and sometimes bloodthirsty) women, and generally has a fine time exploring waters that history has little charted.--Gregory McNamee","price":{"$numberDouble":"4.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515xQT26mJL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B00768D4KC","B00D0UXXZ6","B00DW1X9G6"],"buy_after_viewing":["B00B2H82DW"]},"categories":[["Books","Biographies & Memoirs","Specific Groups","Women"],["Books","History","Military"],["Books","Politics & Social Sciences","Women's Studies"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Biographies & Memoirs","Specific Groups","Women"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","History"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Politics & Social Sciences","Women's Studies"]],"author":null,"title":null,"genres":["Politics & Social Sciences","Women","Specific Groups","Women's Studies","History","Biographies & Memoirs","Military"]}

Taylor, a 14-year-old living on the island of Borneo with her scientist parents, was &#x22;a special sort of test-tube baby.&#x22; Special, indeed. She's one of the first successful human clones, a fact that fills her with resentment. Her angst quickly recedes into the background, though, when rebels attack her family's compound, and she must flee through the jungle with her wounded younger brother and a partly tame orangutan. Her battle for survival is gripping, but as in Halam'sDr. Franklin's Island(2002), the ordeal is just part of the story. Once rescued, Taylor faces a welter of new challenges: numbing grief, an awkward relationship with her guardian (her genetic &#x22;mother&#x22;), and uncertainty about the fate of her faithful ape companion. The teen-as-biotech-experiment premise will remind many readers of Peter Dickinson'sEva(1988),although this novel isn't as cohesive. Though the harrowing losses Taylor suffers may prove too much for some readers, the taut suspense and Taylor's gritty intensity will compel many YAs, especially those who gravitate to dense, philosophically minded sf.Jennifer MattsonCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

Kim O'Hara, the orphaned son of an Irish soldier stationed in India, is neither innocent nor victimized.  Raised by an opium-addicted half-caste woman since his equally dissolute father's death, the boy has grown up in the streets of Lahore:Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the vernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain sing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the small boys of the bazar; Kim was white--a poor white of the very poorest.From his father and the woman who raised him, Kim has come to believe that a great destiny awaits him. The details, however, are a bit fuzzy, consisting as they do of the woman's addled prophecies of &#x22;'a great Red Bull on a green field, and the Colonel riding on his tall horse, yes, and'--dropping into English--'nine hundred devils.'&#x22;In the meantime, Kim amuses himself with intrigues, executing &#x22;commissions by night on the crowded housetops for sleek and shiny young men of fashion.&#x22; His peculiar heritage as a white child gone native, combined with his &#x22;love of the game for its own sake,&#x22; makes him uniquely suited for a bigger game. And when, at last, the long-awaited colonel comes along, Kim is recruited as a spy in Britain's struggle to maintain its colonial grip on India. Kipling was, first and foremost, a man of his time; born and raised in India in the 19th century, he was a fervid supporter of the Raj. Nevertheless, his portrait of India and its people is remarkably sympathetic. Yes, there is the stereotypical Westernized Indian Babu Huree Chander with his atrocious English, but there is also Kim's friend and mentor, the Afghani horse trader Mahub Ali, and the gentle Tibetan lama with whom Kim travels along the Grand Trunk Road. The humanity of his characters consistently belies Kipling's private prejudices, and raisesKimabove the mere ripping good yarn to the level of a timeless classic.--Alix Wilber","price":{"$numberDouble":"17.95"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fzVeGSrhL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_viewed":["B000FC1KG6","B004UNGYK8","B000FC1JOY","B000FC1L56","B001LOEG1S"]},"categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction","Classics"],["Books","Literature & Fiction","Contemporary"],["Books","Literature & Fiction","History & Criticism","Movements & Periods"],["Books","Literature & Fiction","Literary"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Classics","British & Irish"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Classics","Coming of Age"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Classics","Historical"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Contemporary Fiction"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","History & Criticism","Movements & Periods","Victorian"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Literary Fiction","Action & Adventure"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Literary Fiction","British & Irish"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Literary Fiction","Classics"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Literary Fiction","Historical"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Teen & Young Adult"]],"author":"Pankaj Mishra","title":"Kim (Modern Library 100 Best Novels)","genres":["Historical","Coming of Age","Action & Adventure","Literary","Classics","Contemporary Fiction","Victorian","History & Criticism","Contemporary","Literary Fiction","Literature & Fiction","Teen & Young Adult","Movements & Periods","British & Irish"]}

She does that over and again in this collection of soul musings focused on healing. Whether she is reflecting on the surroundings of her backyard screen house or pondering a bad day with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms, Wolf is a master at converting the ordinary into the extraordinary. Drawing from a rich vocabulary to express herself, she explores each subject like a miner panning for gold, extracting the essence of a lesson or truth, then presenting it almost matter-of-factly. Whether she is writing about a personal betrayal, the aftermath of her abusive marriage or how a friend's life was shattered by the Oklahoma City bombing, Wolf invites self-reflection. Although she gazes inwardly, she does not stay there, always moving on to some new place in her spiritual journey. For example, in &#x22;Scene from a Mall,&#x22; Wolf gets lost in comparing her own interior muddle with the slick facades of the shoppers below as she ascends an escalator. By the time she reaches the top, she realizes envy has bitten her and she emerges from her reverie with a new esteem for those she is watching. Wolf's background is Christian, but readers of all faiths, especially those in tune with the spiritual path, will find her writings insightful.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.","categories":[["Books","Religion & Spirituality","Spirituality"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Spirituality"]],"author":null,"title":null,"genres":["Religion & Spirituality","Spirituality"]}

As many Americans grapple with unemployment, diminished 401(k)s, crumbling stock market holdings and seemingly insurmountable debt, the bright-eyed and bushy-tailed financial sage comes to the rescue, offering this guide to understanding some of the most basic principles of money. In her signature charismatic style, Orman (The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom; The Road to Wealth; etc.) lays out &#x22;simple truths that will help you to be okay no matter what happens in your financial life.&#x22; These laws are essentially common sense standards, certainly reminiscent of phrases from the author's previous books yet still undeniably powerful. For example, law number one, &#x22;truth creates money, lies destroy it,&#x22; rings with simplicity while teaching a mighty rule about staying true to oneself and not embellishing to disillusion oneself or others. Each law is described in a separate chapter, with examples from Orman's life and several everyday folk. Indeed, readers will see themselves in these stories, and they, coupled with Orman's reality-based financial advice, will help make solutions clear for many. A guide included in the book allows readers to reflect on their financial past, order their priorities, organize savings plans and more. This is a shining example of Orman's now-perfected holistic approach to nuts-and-bolts economics.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.","price":{"$numberDouble":"17.95"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mNreXh-BL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B004IPP8TG","B000FC1RXM","B000OI0G48","B0036S4ELY","B000JMKR7U","B000PC71Q4","B00JQHB67O","B00CLT31D6","B007IUGLYO","B004Z1LJH8","B00B6ZTMUM","B005723KEO","B007O2DASQ","B009CG8Z3C","B000FC0U08","B008XBP120","B0045JLPYC","B00DNBE8P6","B003JTHBWY","B000SEH5BA","B00B6EFPEK","B00CME4Z8A","B006GG0U0C","B00CJQFRMY","B009PFN0MQ","B004AM59WI","B00IJZLX72","B00DPM7U6C","B003V5WTJ6","B00DGZKQ1E","B00DJ735O4","B000FCK20G","B000FCJXTC","B0061OUU0E","B007WNBYXA","B00F8KX5HW","B00AXS5EAK","B005OR9MP8","B001QNVP7M","B008VV60EK","B0052RDJFE","B000QFBXHI","B002BXH5WU","B0076ON81G","B0081S0G4I"],"buy_after_viewing":["B004IPP8TG","B0036S4ELY","B000OI0G48","B000FC1RXM"]},"categories":[["Books","Business & Money","Personal Finance","Budgeting & Money Management"],["Books","Self-Help"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Business & Money","Personal Finance","Budgeting & Money Management","Money Management"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Health, Fitness & Dieting"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Self-Help"]],"author":null,"title":null,"genres":["Health, Fitness & Dieting","Business & Money","Personal Finance","Budgeting & Money Management","Self-Help","Money Management"]}

Long presumed dead, Stump has crawled out of his hole with a new identity and a sinister plan to eliminate Mary. His bait: Mary's three-month-old goddaughter, Lily, daughter of Mary's ex-lover Jonathan Walkingstick and his new bride, Ruth. Mary has just finished her closing arguments for a kiddie porn conviction when she learns that Lily has been kidnapped. As Mary follows the kidnapper's trail, it becomes apparent that the kidnapper is far more interested in Mary than Lily. Bissell slips plenty of information from her earlier books into the story to keep readers up to speed, and some will be pleased to note that this book contains significantly fewer gruesome elements than her previous shockers. Though details of child endangerment and child pornography are still stomach-churning, Bissell's strong writing and clever, didn't-see-that-coming denouement will keep readers enthralled. If Bissell can better flesh out her characters' motivations, she may soon be keeping company with the likes of Tami Hoag and Sandra Brown.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

TheMeditationsof Marcus Aurelius, translated and introduced by Gregory Hays, by that standard, is very worthwhile, indeed. Hays suggests that its most recent incarnation--as a self-help book--is not only valid, but may be close to the author's intent. The book, which Hays calls, fondly, a &#x22;haphazard set of notes,&#x22; is indicative of the role of philosophy among the ancients in that it is &#x22;expected to provide a 'design for living.'&#x22; And it does, both aphoristically (&#x22;Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly.&#x22;) and rhetorically (&#x22;What is it in ourselves that we should prize?&#x22;).

They were, said then Secretary of Defense Neil McElroy, &#x22;given the ideal preparation to serve at the very heart of the home.&#x22; But the daughter of Czechoslovakian parents, whose diplomat father moved them to the U.S. when his country fell under Soviet control, was far too intellectually ambitious to be sent into domestic exile. SeasonedTimepolitical reporter Ann Blackman's biography describes how Albright moved past the expectations of her time--and the challenges of being an immigrant--to become the highest-ranking woman in the history of U.S. politics when Bill Clinton picked her to be his second secretary of state.Through a peripatetic childhood, marriage and divorce, and the increasing demands of her work as a Ph.D. candidate, professor, and United States ambassador to the United Nations, Albright is revealed to be driven and demanding, a savvy diplomat who has forged relationships with world leaders and with a small, sustaining group of powerful American women. Extensively researched and enlivened by anecdote,Seasons of Her Lifeis a fascinating study of a very unusual and dynamic woman's rise to power.--Maria Dolan","author":null,"title":null,"genres":["Historical","Women","Specific Groups","Biographies & Memoirs","Political","United States","Leaders & Notable People"]}

He's hot for her, too, but fate intervenes in the form of Kate's best friend, Elliot Winston. Elliot and his boyfriend, Brice, are determined to keep Kate from committing romantic folly yet again. In a plot twist that the late Goldsmith (The First Wives Club, etc.) might have calledQueer Eye for the Straight Goy, Elliot notices that every time Billy dumps a girl, she marries the next guy she dates. So instead of following heart and loins to Billy's bed, Kate helps Elliot engineer a match between Billy and Bina, whose putative fianc&eacute;, Jack, went to Hong Kong without giving her the anticipated diamond. Minor complications abound, as Bina dates Billy but falls for someone else, and Kate's burning jealousy blinds her to the truth long after the reader sees it. Goldsmith's fans will perhaps forgive the almost farcical absence of reality; others may resent not only the illogic but also the stereotyping of gays, Jews, working-class Catholics and nearly everybody else. If Goldsmith had affection for her characters, she hid it well.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecac2b19a853d9636bf"},"asin":"B000FC1RXC","description":"A road trip turns into a vehicle for family redemption and reconciliation in Tilghman's heartfelt but clunky second novel (after 1996'sMason's Retreat), which revolves around the efforts of a dying Maryland politician to put his affairs in order. Eric Alwin is the narrator, a disaffected middle-aged New York ad man who spends his weekends in Maryland caring for his father, Frank, a former politician who can barely speak or move after a debilitating stroke. The road to Frank's demise takes a sharp turn when he demands that his son accompany him on a difficult drive to Alabama to present his apologies to his estranged ex-wife. The trip succeeds despite some rough moments, but Frank is determined to get through a similar agenda with other family members. Gathering passengers along the way, father and son finally end up in Columbus, Ohio, meeting yet another (unexpected) relative. The concept of road trip as catharsis and reconciliation works well in the early going, but as the book progresses, the geographical structure makes the novel read like an awkward emotional travelogue, and the writing lapses into mawkish melodrama (&#x22;What is forgiveness? Is it choosing to ignore and overlook? Water under the dam? Is it a test, or an embrace?&#x22;). Tilghman injects little fresh life into his well-worn conceit.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecac2b19a853d9636c3"},"asin":"B000FC1PYS","description":"The psychologically suspenseful story of Jack Rathbone, a &#x22;latter-day Gauguin&#x22; who flees his native England to pursue a career as a painter as well as a volatile relationship with artist Vera Savage, is narrated by his sister, Gin, whose obvious devotion skews her perspective. McGrath's sixth novel unfolds in a series of flashbacks, from Jack's childhood in England to Greenwich Village in the 1950s and, eventually, to the Honduran town of Port Mungo, where Jack develops a style he calls &#x22;tropicalism&#x22; or, more sinisterly, &#x22;malarial.&#x22; The birth of daughter Peg threatens the marriage, and her mysterious death, at 16, dooms it; Jack moves in with his sister in New York. Ostensibly, the search for the truth behind Peg's death propels the narrative, but the mix of flashbacks and present action is confusing, and Gin's role feels trumped up. The book becomes even more baroque when Jack's second daughter, raised in England, moves to New York and agrees to let her father paint her, in the nude.

The players' voices emit every nuance required to let listeners experience the swashbuckling deeds of the famous heroic threesome and the boy called D'Artagnan who wants to join their ranks. When the young man arrives in Paris with the wish to enlist with the King's Musketeers, he finds himself challenged to three duels in his first afternoon in the city by men who turn out to be Porthos, Aramis, and Athos-the Three Musketeers. Instead of fighting against them, the twists of fate have D'Artagnan battling for them against the evil Cardinal Richelieu's guards. After demonstrating his worth with a sword, D'Artagnan proves more of his mettle by journeying to England to foil a plot to embarrass France's Queen Anne, the former Anne of Austria. D'Artagnan saves his queen but loses the woman he loves, so he seeks vengeance and, in turn, instills himself firmly in the ranks of the Musketeers. The flavor of the original is evident even though this abridged version includes only highlights in its retelling.Joanne K.

Son of a London bookie, husband of a Swedish beauty and owner of an enviable stable of horses, Edward de Jersey is also the retired mastermind of one of Britain's most famous unsolved robberies, a man who would rather die than give up his life of privilege. Step by step, he plans, prepares and executes a modern version of the Great Train Robbery, overcoming computerized security systems and penetrating royal protocol. De Jersey brutally dispenses enemies and boldly protects friends on both sides of the Atlantic, but it is his team of accomplices that makes this classic crime caper a compelling read, among them Pamela, the ex-con television actress; Lord Westbrook, the disgraced palace equerry; and Marsh, the computer whiz turned crook. La Plante's knowledge of the sport of kings, her sense of irony in human relationships and her deceptively cool narrative style allow her to visit familiar crime fiction territory with aplomb. She does not create the equal of herMasterpiece Theatredetective Jane Tennison, but she weaves an intricate story of crime and character that starts off slowly and then keeps the reader guessing as it gallops to a photo finish.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At seventeen Sabatini moved to England, where, after a brief stint in the business world, he started to write. His major breakthrough came with Scaramouche, which became an international bestseller and was followed by the equally successful Captain Blood. All his earlier books were then rushed into reprint. Many of his novels were subsequently adapted into classic films which appealed to both a male and female market with their drama, romance and action, set against a variety of historical settings.

Their four &#x22;bedrock&#x22; principles are &#x22;Equilibrium is a precursor to death&#x22;; &#x22;Living things move toward the edge of chaos&#x22;; &#x22;Components of living systems self-organize&#x22; in response to turmoil; and &#x22;Living systems cannot be directed along a linear path.&#x22; Writing with clarity and verve, the authors illustrate these larger points by comparing the functioning of organic systems (e.g., Yellowstone National Park), the behavior of organisms (dental plaque) and of insects (fire ants) with detailed case studies of five companies (British Petroleum, Hewlett-Packard, Monsanto, Royal Dutch/Shell and Sun Microsystems) and the U.S. Army. Practical-minded readers will appreciate their nitty-gritty insights into the relative advantages of &#x22;adaptive&#x22; and traditional &#x22;operational&#x22; leadership, as well as their consistent distillation of concrete business guidelines. While the authors aver that &#x22;there is no permanent victory in this eternal cycle of life and death,&#x22; they make a persuasive case that &#x22;understanding living systems does not decisively win the game but, most assuredly, it improves the odds.&#x22; (Nov. 1)Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.","author":"Richard Pascale","title":"Surfing the Edge of Chaos: The Laws of Nature and the New Laws of Business","genres":["Company Profiles","Management & Leadership","Strategy & Competition","Systems & Planning","Management Science","Business & Money","Company Histories","Strategic Management","Biography & History","Management"]}

(Reagan's absence is due to his illness; the obvious omission of Clinton is never explained.) Avoiding talk of policy and politics, Greene delves into the safe minutiae of presidential lives: he peppers the fraternity with inane queries about exercise routines (&#x22;Is the Secret Service around when you do your sit-ups?&#x22;), wardrobe, favorite songs and movies (Ford's isMrs. Doubtfire), the novelty of sleeping in the White House and wounded feelings over partisan name-calling. Above all, he goggles at their unfathomable fall from exalted supercelebrity to approachable semicelebrity. &#x22;Can you just go into a clothing store?&#x22; Greene demands of Ford. &#x22;What about that whole thing of going into the changing room?&#x22; Greene's few wrestlings with the meaning of the office (&#x22;It's like you're president of every town,&#x22; he blurts to a preternaturally patient Bush) can verge on the inchoate. Carter, with a more substantial postpresidential public life than the others, receives the most substantial profile as a serious, tight-lipped micro-manager.Copyright &#xa9; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Buddy LeBlanc was born in the Louisiana bayou, where magnetic storms disrupt the effects of gravity and force people to anchor themselves to the earth with Velcro. As he grows up, things only get stranger, and matters come to a head when a sprawling conglomerate announces that it has bought out the bankrupt U.S. government. Totalitarian changes begin immediately, forcing Buddy&mdash;who has a gift for performing minor miracles and has been touring with the circus&mdash;to join up with his brilliant love interest, journalist Rhonda Jefferson, and a band of ragtag malcontents know as the Dreamers to organize epic protests. Murphy's political and social satire consistently hits its targets, but his storytelling is often disorganized and chaotic&mdash;he introduces extraneous characters and convoluted, unnecessary subplots at a frenzied pace and gets bogged down in some lackluster side plots involving Buddy's family. This could have been a brilliant novel with more narrative focus, but the lack of a solid story line makes it more of a cult curio.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecac2b19a853d963732"},"asin":"B000FC2QBO","description":"What differentiates a true lady from a common woman? Is it blood, environment, education or simply hauteur? The late, prolific Cookson deftly explores these questions in this dizzying upstairs-downstairs &#x22;romance of adversity&#x22; set in rural Edwardian England. Annabella Lagrange is a lovely 17-year-old lady-to-be... or not to be, whose aristocratic childhood comes to a crashing halt when her womanizing papa, who has just bankrupted his wife Rosina's glass factory, reveals that Annabella is actually the daughter of a local whorehouse madam. Manuel Mendoza, a predictably dark and handsome self-made workman, helps Annabella begin a new, humble life as a farmhouse maid with an invented past. Cookson liberally heaps mental anguish and cruel twists of fate upon her heroine as Annabella tentatively navigates &#x22;life as lived by the majority of people.&#x22; Over the course of a trying year, Annabella keeps her ladylike dignity&mdash;and virginity&mdash;as she entangles herself in the bonds of love. Is it truly possible for &#x22;the upper class to come down and the working class to come up and meet in the middle&#x22; in the realms of love and business? Despite some heavy-handed foreshadowing and spell-breaking asides about the social limitations of the Edwardian era, Cookson proves herself a seasoned storyteller, whose plentiful list of titles keeps historical women's fiction fans in the hardcover aisle years after the author's death.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecac2b19a853d96373c"},"asin":"B000FC2KJC","description":"Despite what the subtitle says, most of the high-profile cases that draw Seidemann's focus are from the last quarter-century (a much shorter span than that covered in another volume of closing arguments,And the Walls Came Tumbling Downby Michael Lief and Mitchell Caldwell. The usual suspects (so to speak) are here: Johnnie Cochran's summation in O.J. Simpson's criminal trial, the prosecutors' opening statements in the cases of Adolf Eichmann and Timothy McVeigh. Seidemann, an assistant DA in New York City for over two decades, also offers three cases in which defendants represented themselves, including accused al-Qaeda conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, though these and other cases (Martha Stewart, Marv Albert) seem included more for their notoriety than for the quality of the prose or legal arguments. But then there is William Jennings Bryan's eloquent, if debatable summation in the Scopes trial, proclaiming the amorality, if not the immorality, of science. Seidemann does achieve his two goals: to entertain the reader with legal drama and to remind the reader of some important details&mdash;that O.J., for instance, won his criminal case but lost in the civil suit. Seidemann's greatest service is to provide brief but thorough annotations of the cases, in which he considers some of the reasons behind an argument's success or failure.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What begins as an act of charity, though--a chance for the tough-hided and perspicacious, but lonely ex-con paparazza to aid another female at loose ends in the world--soon lands Nina in the quirky company of space-alien worshippers, fugitive teenage cultists, and grave robbers intent on plundering the mortal remains of immortal Hollywood icons.Our heroine (last seen inBurning Garbo) doesn't really have time to worry about 15-year-old Theresa, a celebrity-obsessed Midwesterner whose lukewarm tip about a has-been screen hunk results in Nina being roughed up, her cameras trashed; she already has her own problems. The prominently pierced photog is being evicted from her Venice Beach apartment; her long-abused mother has just perished from a stroke; and her elder sister, whom she hasn't seen in 24 years, has barely reappeared in her life, before she rips Nina off for $19,000--and is beaten to death during a raid on the crypt of silent-movie legend Rudolph Valentino. That last crime seems ideal fare forScandal Times, the sensationalistic journal from which Nina draws her paychecks--especially since it follows an assault on the Indiana grave of actor James Dean, who died in a 1955 highway accident. But as Nina struggles to exorcise her grief and anger through decisive action, by exposing Hollywood's enigmatic Church of Divine Thespians, executing a Rockford-style desert car rescue, and fleeing a blaze meant to send her to her own last reward, she unearths a tale so outlandish as to amaze even jadedScandal Timesreaders. And the fatally na&#xEF;ve Theresa sits at the center of it all.Eversz hit a pell-mell storytelling pace withBurning Garbo, which he maintains in this clever sequel. He capitalizes nicely on the lore and landmarks of Los Angeles, and over the course of four hip mysteries (beginning with 1996'sShooting Elvis) has developed a punk protagonist intrepid enough to draw reader attention, and compassionate enough to hold onto it. Though the mastermind behindDigging James Dean's bloodshed boasts all the subtlety of a Bela Lugosi villain, Nina Zero's relentless pursuit of her sibling's slayer makes this wild ride worthwhile. It may even owe a debt to Dean himself, who said, &#x22;Dream as if you'll live forever. Live as if you'll die today.&#x22; --J.

The quintessential Jewish Princess with a job in name only in her father's advertising agency, she lunches and shops more than works, but deep down she is unhappy with her lack of real involvement. When her father suffers a heart attack and turns his business over to a hated rival who actually expects her to work for her paycheck, Shelly is transformed. Assigned to low-end accounts like a tire store and Falafel Shack, instead of having a tantrum, she channels her anger, comes to work on time, and puts in a creative effort with profitable results. There are a few bumps along the way, but as she improves her life, she helps bring meaning to her sister's life, too, and romance to her best friend. A bit predictable and slightly oversexed, this will nonetheless provide lightweight fun for Wax's fans and other chick-lit and hip romance enthusiasts.Danise HooverCopyright &#xa9; American Library Association.

The two have made it to the city of Timoch but have a long way to go. Way back before the moon was &#x22;squeezed,&#x22; Conrad and Xmary returned from Barnard's Star with a cargo of that world's cryogenically frozen human children. What to do with all these mortals? The queendom is already overrun with billions of its own,immorbidchildren, and the violent Fatalists, a group of mortality advocates, tend to further destabilize matters. Bruno hires Conrad to crush the moon in a desperate attempt to find space for the masses of humanity. Refugees from other colonies straggle back to Sol, Queen Tamra struggles to equitably resolve associated problems, and events spiral toward destruction as well as a final battle when Conrad and Bruno confront the Glimmer King and his metal armies.

Kate has given up her rich clients and is now writing a book about the New York School of painters of the 1930s. After someone slashes a painting by Willem de Kooning, which was loaned to a museum by Kate's late husband, she reluctantly returns to police work. She decides to help Det. Monty Murphy, the NYPD's entire art squad, find out who's behind this and other slashings, which include a Jackson Pollock, a Franz Kline and finally the collectors who owned the spoiled pictures. Kate and Monty make a believable pair of colleagues, and Santlofer's own black-and-white artwork advances the plot. His writing and plotting are no match for his superior brushwork, however, which makes for an inventive and curious book.Copyright &#xa9; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Unfortunately, too many pieces of the puzzle remain missing for them to effectively defend what's left of the country of Ile-Rien, let alone liberate the rest of it. When the sphere-entrapped sorcerer Arisilde sends them a spell that eventually leads to &#x22;a train station for world-gates,&#x22; Tremaine and her cohorts may have finally found a way to drive the Gardier out of Ile-Rien. New readers are advised to start with the first in the series,The Wizard Hunters(2003), as an acquaintance with numerous characters and previous action is essential.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecac2b19a853d963765"},"asin":"B000FCKIAK","description":"Lady Diana Fordham spent 10 years waiting for the marquis of Templeton (&#x22;Temple&#x22;) to express an interest in her. Now in an attempt to get him to finally drop the fashionable, foppish charade he has presented to society for years and become the hero she knows he truly is, Diana allows herself to be abducted by the notorious Viscount Cordell. Both personal and professional reasons send Temple in pursuit of Diana, who has also become the target of several penniless noblemen with hopes of catching the spinster heiress themselves. With orders to steal the bride to-be and see that she is wed for her own safety to any suitable man, Temple never expected he would wind up wanting to marry the exasperating yet all too tempting Diana himself! Humor and passion were never more expertly entwined. Boyle cleverly matches up a tart-tongued, brilliantly resourceful heroine with an honorable, sinfully seductive hero, and then deftly sifts a dash of dangerous intrigue, wonderfully unique secondary characters, and a generous measure of wicked wit into this sweetly romantic, deliciously sensual love story.John CharlesCopyright &#xa9; American Library Association.

Conley, who has compiled several other quirky dictionaries, became a sort of cult hero when he put an early edition of this one online, where it garnered a huge following among people surfing the web for the odd and amusing. For each letter, Conley gives dozens of meanings, which he often supports with citations from literature, science and pop culture. The definitions are arranged in groups like &#x22;shapes and sizes,&#x22; military and &#x22;people, places, things,&#x22; some of which are common to most letters and others that pertain to only one, like &#x22;exertions of power,&#x22; which has two entries under &#x22;d.&#x22; Conley's own explanations are brief; the bulk of the book is taken up by quotations where he found a particular usage, and these come from sources as diverse as Joyce's Ulysses, Winnie-the-Pooh and the American Medical Association. Many of the instances Conley refers to are arcane or technical, and he does a cursory job of explaining the project and justifying his methods, so some entries will leave readers baffled. (Consider &#x22;v-bob&#x22;: &#x22;a strong frame shaped like an isosceles triangle, turning on a pivot at its axis, and used as a bell crank to change the direction of a main pump rod.&#x22;) Even so, anyone fascinated by language (and especially fans of word games like Scrabble) will be thrilled with this unique resource.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1920, however, his luck changed when Scribner bought his first manuscript, This Side of Paradise, and introduced him to the world, which welcomed him warmly. This latest Library of America volume includes that first novel plus several works written during Fitzgerald's younger and more vulnerable years: Flappers and Philosophers (short stories, 1920), The Beautiful and Damned (novel, 1922), and Tales of the Jazz Age (short stories, 1922). The short stories include such gems as &#x22;Bernice Bobs Her Hair,&#x22; &#x22;The Ice Palace,&#x22; and &#x22;A Diamond as Big as the Ritz.&#x22; Though all this material is readily available, and, one hopes, always will be, it's wonderful having Fitzgerald's fledgling works together in a quality hardcover.

Before he died, he had been at work onLife Interrupted, a monologue about the aftermath of a horrific car accident he suffered while traveling in Ireland. Gray is replaced here by legendary playwright and actor Shepard, who provides a gravelly dignity to Gray's ruminations on illness and death. Shepard does a nice job of pausing between sentences, as if thinking of how best to describe his conundrum. Shepard is joined by novelist Francine Prose, who reads her own lengthy tribute to Gray and eulogies for Gray by figures including filmmaker Aviva Kempner, Gray's stepdaughter Marisa and his widow, Kathleen Russo. Their tributes, given at the time of his death, are far less polished than Gray's own monologue, but as homespun expressions of love and affection in the aftermath of his death, are perhaps the most affecting aspect of this well-wrought tribute to Gray's legacy.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Marzipan &#x22;Marzi&#x22; McCarty, a 20ish California art school dropout, writes quirky comics. Marzi's also the night manager&ndash;barista of Genius Loci, a Santa Cruz coffeehouse decorated by vanished muralist Garamond Ray to hold in elemental Evil. The wild adventures that Marzi concocts for her cowpunk character, Rangergirl, start coming true after her artsy friends become obsessed with freeing weird gods. When the Outlaw, a representative of everyone's worst fears, busts loose from its surreal corral, the Desert Lands, it's up to Marzi, the new artist-guardian, to save the whole shootin' match from disaster. Pratt's simplistic message, glimpsed sporadically behind clouds of neo-hippie jargon, self-consciously naughty language, outdoor sex and nasty violence, is pretentious and even a little na&iuml;ve&mdash;that art can trap our fears and hold them at bay.

The characters are real and endearing, and the storyline is a romance lover's delight.

I know nothing about inventions and inventors--or the world they inhabit--but Ms. Wolf's skilled writing made them seem like my next-door-neighbors. Neighbors that I like very much. Ms. Wolf has penned a warm, totally delightful romance. Highly Recommended.-- Under The Covers Book ReviewsThe Marriage Patent was a refreshing read without all the forced love scenes that seem to be prevalent among books today. The development of Julie and Mark's relationship was beautiful to read. Well done on a sweetly moving story. Patent for Passion practically invents love all over again!

In a fogbound setting evocative of Conan Doyle, newly appointed Superintendent Monk and his river patrol watch helplessly as two young lovers plunge to their deaths from a bridge. Monk's exhaustive investigation, aided by his activist wife, Hester, soon reveals a deadly conflict between the two lovers' families over the hasty construction of a vast sewer complex built to prevent a recurrence of the &#x22;Great Stink&#x22; and typhoid epidemic of 1863. A riveting pursuit of an unknown assassin brings Monk in contact with the city's most destitute, one of several incidents highlighting the growing conflict between the abject poor and those whose houses have such luxuries as sewers and gas pipes. Some readers may have trouble with the cockney dialogue, but all will relish the last-minute twists that lead to a compelling resolution.(Mar.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Jeremy Iversen, a 24-year-old Stanford graduate and the author of the novel 21, infiltrated California's Mirador High (fictional name, real school) for a semester to find out. Posing as a high-school transfer student, Iversen discovers what many have discovered before: that high school is &#x22;an institution founded on popularity, sports, ass kissing, and corruption.&#x22; Although Iversen's tone can be entertaining and his descriptions occasionally catch the reader's attention, his story-of an almost out-of-control school in which social cliques (the jocks, nerds, skaters, etc. of any '80s film), alcohol and sex rule and the principal and many teachers are clueless figureheads-is one that has been told too many times. Iversen also has a penchant for grandiose statements about the school system (&#x22;The vast and functional cycle, far greater than she or any other entity, would repeat without end until the civilization that sustained it ultimately dissolved as all phenomena must&#x22;), and the author's preface about &#x22;compromises with characters and chronology&#x22; hobbles reportorial integrity.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecac2b19a853d9637a7"},"asin":"B000JMKSW4","description":"Grade 9 Up&ndash;Jenna Abbott, 15, is struggling to come to terms with the car accident that killed her mother and nearly took her own life as well. Formerly athletic and smart, she suddenly finds herself unable to concentrate or communicate with anyone. She is broken in both body and spirit and desperate to escape into the blue, which is how she remembers the drug-induced haze immediately after the accident. Not wanting anything to do with her father and his new family in California, she moves to New Hampshire to live with her aunt and uncle, and begins looking for ways to escape. She steals OxyContin from her uncle's medicine cabinet and becomes friends with Trina, who is dealing with her own substance-abuse problems. It takes two near-disasters for Jenna to tentatively open up to her classmate Crow and face her fears and grief. Oates is at her best telling the stories of teenage girls dealing with internal trauma and outside pressures. Jenna's pain at losing the only person truly close to her and the isolation she creates for herself are poignantly drawn. Her understanding that her choices are not what her mother would want for her is especially telling and may speak to teens in comparable situations. Similar in topic to E. R. Frank'sWrecked(S &amp; S, 2005), this powerful novel is well worth reading.&ndash;Stephanie L.

It's suspense with a little bit of science fiction, but not enough to scare away readers who don't enjoy SF.-- Louise Klement, Dreamforge WebzineThe plot of this story is as off-beat as the characters. The dialogue is earthy and realistic, the love scenes romantic and intimate. The writing is typically Bain and that's always a plus. With charm, occasional humor, and disarming sincerity, he spins a mystery-love story-science fiction tale that will keep the reader on the edge of his seat from the beginning paragraph to the last sentence of the epilogue.-- Billy Houston's ReviewsA highly readable and recommended book! This book grabs your interest from the very first paragraph. 4 stars-- Vicky Duby, Scribes World","genres":["Science Fiction","Science Fiction & Fantasy","Literature & Fiction","Mystery","Women Sleuths","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense"]}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecac2b19a853d9637bd"},"asin":"B000JMKTMI","description":"OneOn a late spring day in Highgate, north of London, the warm air was heavy  with the promise of rain. William Swift sat in a room on the third floor  of Ludlow House and gazed with determined hatred at his father, who peered  back at him with a demon&#8217;s eyes and a madman&#8217;s smile.Evening was still hours away, but in that chamber darkness had already  fallen. It was no ordinary darkness, no mundane arrival of night. It was a  living, churning shadow that had swallowed the room and blotted out every  bit of natural daylight, so that the   windows were black as pitch and a fog of darkness pulsed and breathed,  filling the space between the two living beings who sat facing each other  on hard wooden chairs.The only light came from thin white candles that had been placed every six  inches in a rough circle around the center of the room, a circle that  included both William and his father, Henry, within its boundaries. The  candles had been made by virgin hands and cooled in holy water, and an  unnatural blue tint engulfed each wick. The color was beautiful and  calming and strong. The shifting shadows that swirled about could not  touch that uncanny blue light.The room had once been a nursery. Both William and his younger sister,  Tamara, had slept here in their infancy. He was determined that once the  demon was gone, and his father was restored, no one would ever use the  nursery again. With his own hands he would board it up, nail it shut, and  remove the knob. They were, each member of the Swift family, forever  stained by their contact with the evil and the damned, and their home was  equally tainted.This infestation in particular, though, could not be allowed to remain. At  the same moment as he and Tamara had inherited the abilities and duties of  the Protectors of Albion&#8212;novices though they were in a perilous and  eternal war&#8212;their father had been possessed by this demon Oblis. As they  studied and practiced and honed their knowledge and their skills, each new  triumph convinced them that now they would have the fortitude needed to   exorcise the creature from Henry Swift.Yet each time they tried, they failed.William had been growing more and more restless. The knowledge that his  father was trapped within his own body, enslaved to the demon that was  housed therein, haunted the young man, awake and asleep. His work as  manager of the family bank, Swift&#8217;s of London, had suffered. Too often he  wandered around, little more than a ghost himself, dark circles under his  eyes. At times he nodded off, waking to find himself in the midst of a  conversation, or having walked into a room without remembering why he&#8217;d  gone there or what he&#8217;d been seeking.But now the moment had come. He would not rest until the demon had been  extracted from his father&#8217;s flesh.The creature sat across from him, grinning in the shadows that danced with  the blue light of those blessed candles. The eyes that opposed him were  not those of Henry Swift, but of Oblis. The demon often attempted to  manipulate the members of the household by speaking in Henry&#8217;s voice,  exhibiting the gentle kindness of a father. And from time to time, William  thought that perhaps   it really was his father, wrestling the demon down or slipping through  when Oblis was distracted.But he could never be sure, could never know if he spoke to the man or the  beast.All of that was going to end.The darkness was cold. A rime of ice frosted the windows and the floors,  the walls and the chairs. William and the demon stared at each other, both  breathing evenly. Oblis&#8217;s expression was strangely curious.In the center of the room, precisely midway between them, stood an  elegant, handmade perfume bottle swirled with pink and red and blue glass  and stoppered with a handmade glass butterfly.&#8220;Well, now, this is lovely, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; the demon said in Henry&#8217;s voice.  &#8220;Just the two of us, and a pretty bauble.&#8221;William glared at him. &#8220;We&#8217;re not alone.&#8221;Oblis sat back in the chair, comfortable in spite of the chains that bound  him to it. They were, after all, only physical bonds to prevent him from  causing harm to Henry&#8217;s body, or attacking   anyone who entered the room. Once the chains themselves had held many  spells, binding magic. But he had managed to escape more than once, and  William and Tamara had become very, very careful. The numerous spells that  kept him prisoner were in the walls themselves; they would not allow him  to leave the room while his demonic essence was within the flesh of Henry  Swift. The young Protectors made no attempt to shackle his spirit  alone&#8212;they wanted the demon to depart their father&#8217;s flesh, more than  anything, and their spells would not prevent that&#8212;but Oblis was not quite  through tormenting them yet.&#8220;No, we&#8217;re not alone, are we?&#8221; the demon whispered, in his own voice now,  a kind of serpentine rasp that seemed spoken just beside William&#8217;s ear.  &#8220;Your father&#8217;s here with us, isn&#8217;t he? Though he&#8217;s a bit tongue-tied at  the moment.&#8221; He chuckled at his own wit.William remained impassive. He had learned not to rise to the demon&#8217;s bait.Another voice flowed from the darkness. &#8220;This is a bad idea,&#8221; it said. &#8220;I  wish to make certain that, later, you&#8217;ll remember that I warned you.&#8221;The demon arched an eyebrow.&#8220;When I said we weren&#8217;t alone,&#8221; William told him, &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t referring  merely to my father.&#8221;&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m well aware of the presence of the ghost,&#8221; Oblis replied, not  bothering to glance into the shadows from which the voice had come. &#8220;I  simply take no notice. I don&#8217;t like to encourage this impression they  have, that they are of some consequence.&#8221;A low chiming sound filtered into the shadows of the room, and a figure  began to manifest in the corner, beside a blackened window. The specter  had one arm and was dressed in the garb of the Royal Navy, but the navy of  years past, not the present day. Lord Admiral Horatio Nelson was one of  many ghosts who functioned as allies for the Protectors of Albion,  attempting to aid them in defending the mystical soul of England against  sinister forces that would corrupt or destroy it.&#8220;I&#8217;m also not sure what you hoped to gain from the phantom&#8217;s  participation,&#8221; Oblis went on. &#8220;He cannot harm me. Not while I occupy the  form of your dear, dear father.&#8221;William opened his hands. &#8220;True enough. Oh, Horatio could hurt you a great  deal, but he wouldn&#8217;t, as long as you possess my father. But we&#8217;ll soon  have you out of there. And then you&#8217;ll find the fury of a ghost of far  greater consequence than you&#8217;ve ever imagined. We&#8217;ve each a reason to make  you suffer, but I suspect Bodicea&#8217;s vengeance upon you will last an  eternity.&#8221;The demon only scowled, but William saw a flicker of doubt in Oblis&#8217;s eyes  that pleased him. The ritual ought to work, but if it went poorly and  Oblis tried to escape, Horatio ought to be able to hold onto the vapor  demon long enough to imprison him. He might even be able to destroy the  demon once it had left its human host.One way or another, they would cage him. And if they could cage him, they  could destroy him.But the ghost of that brave, if slightly pompous and effete,   admiral had not been enlisted to take part in this ritual as a combatant.  William had simply wanted someone there to watch over him, to warn him if  he seemed to be falling under the demon&#8217;s influence, and to sound an alarm  if the worst happened.&#8220;William . . .&#8221; the ghost cautioned.&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember, Horatio,&#8221; the young man replied.&#8220;You don&#8217;t know if it will work.&#8221;William stared at his father, his gaze locked again upon the eyes of the  demon within. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t. But I&#8217;ve run out of patience.&#8221;Oblis smirked with Henry&#8217;s lips. &#8220;This should be interesting, then.&#8221;Though there was a tremor in his heart, William kept his hands steady as  he raised them, revealing the straight razor clasped in his right hand.

The B and B is deserted and unwelcoming, and weirdness appears to be the order of the day. The tour guide can't find his way, the cook produces inedible messes, and voices and thuds are heard in the supposedly empty inn. When Rachel is struck by lightning and discovers she can see through anything, and Kel acquires supernatural strength, they begin to consider more sinister explanations. The sudden, overwhelming mutual attraction that flares uncontrollably between them and has them engaging in love play at every possible opportunity (and sometimes at the worst possible moment) is just one more puzzling phenomenon for them to explore. Shalvis breaks new ground with this sexy paranormal romance with chick-lit undertones told from both his and her perspectives.Lynne WelchCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

Now place a bunch of villains with super powers, plus one mighty pissed off innocent hero in the pot and you get Terry L. Vinson'sDesolation Island.The book begins with our main and lovable character Ben Thomason reminiscing with an old friend about the good ol' days when ass kicking and chasing villains was an 'honorable' job to have. As the conversation progresses, you experience his views on how the system has changed...but more than that you find out Ben is hiding out, framed for a murder he didn't commit.Immediately within several pages, a reader is thrust into a super fight...and I mean super strength fight with an unsuspecting foe for Ben.Defeated, enraged, and yet framed for another murder, he is now facing life at Desolation Island, the government's top secret 'Alcatrez' for super villains. This enclosure meets every single possible counter measure to fight the gifts these prisoners possess...but does it?Desolation Island was built on a secret plan to host a very mysterious entity, which only a few handpicked were privy to. Determined to unravel and discover the secret of this entity, a small squad of specialists enter this fortress. In a strange turn of events, Ben will be thrust for the fight of his life alongside some of his past friends and foes but more importantly, beside the gal he shunned not long ago.Terry bringsDesolation Islandto life with his individual character profiles, and one can't help but fall in love with Ben's egotistical, macho and sarcastic personae. The whole book was a 'Marvel' delight to read and very easy to visualize as a movie. For those who loveX-men, you'll truly enjoy this great read.&#x22;Lea Schizas - Founder ofMuse Book Reviews","categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction"],["Books","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Thrillers & Suspense","Suspense"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Suspense"]],"genres":["Thrillers & Suspense","Literature & Fiction","Suspense","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense"]}

He served 16 years in the merchant navy.In 1894, at age 36, Conrad reluctantly gave up the sea, partly because of poor health and partly because he had decided on a literary career.","price":{"$numberInt":"0"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419LMyias3L._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B002IPG4IW","B002IPG4IM","B005H49S8Y","B0092SIXMI","B005LSCQ4Y","B003BEEA3K","B002D48LPM","B004TU58G8","B005HJU7HA","B001FB5T4K","B001FB5ST6","B00AZKFDR0","B00FH13KFO","B005FRGD1I","B004RZGUBM","B0036VO52E","B00C4LWNO4","B00803FAKE","B00C448DL8","B008P8UCKW","B00GU4Y46Q","B0030BF0YM","B000JMLBHU","B009BEED6I","B0035LD84G","B004RK0OSW","B007V4F6ZM","B003X4M9F4","B0051EZX8Y","B00DIHBJ16","B004ELAHJA","B002LE8MA8","B004GHNIQQ","B002X78T6U","B003RITK8K","B00AHK02GK","B00895IVKE","B000JQUSBQ","B000SN6IOQ","B002JCSLIU","B002JVWRYU","B004MMERPG","B005GRF3QI","B00BNB8U2U","B0038BRJIO","B003DXA7WM","B00BJSGNQ2","B007L3K1GC","B000JQUU00","B00A07FMZG","B007YUYWQM","B0073VRNYU","B009QA3VY2","B003J35KXW","B002AQSPFY","B000JMLKI0","B005UHIYN8","B001CCCJE0","B002J9HBRK","B00267SZI4","B00ACL3ESC","B008F06J20","B004EHZXVQ","B00A0BFYGO","B003DKK1GW","B004OR1G4O","B002G1ZY4S","B0058KTL34","B008NIGTRY","B0093M15D2","B008NG22FY","B00ETIE3D4","B00DELL628","B0084AMNWQ","B002RKRUTU"],"buy_after_viewing":["B004EHZXVQ","B000SN6IOQ","B004GHNIRK","B000JMLBHU"]},"categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction","Contemporary"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Contemporary Fiction"]],"genres":["Contemporary Fiction","Contemporary","Literature & Fiction"]}

Whether writing about the power of the theatre or the power of the people, Davis was gifted with an ability for remarkable, courageous speech: Calling for a new Constitution in 1968, he said, &#x22;Let us sit down and negotiate a peace treaty among ourselves.&#x22; Davis did not shy away from controversy, be it in defense of the rights of known Communists, or in re-examining the history of African-Americans; writing in 1965, Davis states that &#x22;most of the stereotypes we know about Negroes were invented by Negroes for the purposes of survival and social correction.&#x22; The writer's humor, humility and tremendous inspirational power shine, but suffer from a lack on context. Davis' wife of more than 50 years, the equally renowned actress and activist Ruby Dee, provides commentary at the beginning of most selections, but her notes are often too vague to illuminate Davis' writings properly. Not much elucidation is needed for Davis' eulogy for Malcolm X, perhaps, but subsequent eulogies for less-known figures like actors Godfrey Cambridge and John Randolph could use a biographical sketch. Quibbles aside, this is a great read by a luminous, much-missed American treasure.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Mysterious Island follows the adventures of a group of castaways who use their survivalist savvy to build a functional community on an uncharted island.  A hot-air balloon carrying five passengers and a dog escapes from Richmond, Va., during the American Civil War. It is blown off course and deposited near an obscure island. One of the castaways nearly dies after a skirmish with pirates; he is saved by the unexplained appearance of medicine after the pirates are unexpectedly routed. The group later discovers that their secret helper is the reclusive Captain Nemo (first introduced in Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea), who dies and is buried at sea in his submarine. The castaways are eventually saved by a passing ship.  --The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature","price":{"$numberDouble":"15.95"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sPuWd2JbL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B004EHZXVQ","B00HOH4Q5M","B00EE0YNQ4","B004GHNIRK","B0084AZXKK","B004GHNIQQ","B002RKSZJO","B00DCD53C2","B00BQ06RJG","B004TP8ZZE","B002RKRMSY","B00DX0F4FK","B00EN6LJ2U","B004UJTG6Q","B00BBIT1BO","B00EGXIC1Q","B004UJAOLM","B00DH0LRZM","B00A9V6NV0","B004DCBEWY","B00D0RDWW8","B0084BKY2Q","B00EOAFQVU","B00DH3YVI4","B0082SWC30","B00CFRGIEI","B0084B5TK8","B00EHI1MDK","B0083ZR7BY","B0083Z614S","B0084AXZK0","B005GRF3QI","B005LSCQ4Y","B0084BKZYS","B0083ZMP5C","B008476HBM","B00CW7UFVI","B004TRXX7C","B00K4K6USM","B004TS2B4W","B007Q4DC4O","B0083ZRAJS","B004XVQ73G","B00I9E5G3U","B0083ZL5EY","B00KIAMIFW","B000JMLJAE","B0084BL4NY","B00FCZC2KE","B0083ZBW2Y","B009XJBHHO","B005L632JY","B0084B1OUM","B00GJDMO3I","B000JQUU00","B00D3XAA4M","B0088Q0F5I","B0084BN44Q","B00FNWRSCI","B00846QWM2","B008476UXW","B0082Z1CVQ","B00KJQSVVK","B004FN1P1Q","B00FDS85EM","B0083Z6ESG","B00847VIBQ","B00C448DL8","B00LLJ6VEI","B0083Z3O8Y","B0084B1T8Y","B004UJDLJE","B0083Z6AH6","B004UJCNKC","B000JQUVMC","B004UJ7VJU","B0083Z40N2","B00C4CH0UA","B002RKRUTU","B00D6N6Y5S","B00BHM73FA","B00IO4C6HY","B0084AMNWQ","B00IJYII4E","B0084B050M","B0083Z12V0","B0084AVKZ2","B00DDOGGYE","B0084961ZM","B0084AXZRI","B0082Q69I6","B0082RHRHC","B0084B1X2Q"],"buy_after_viewing":["B004EHZXVQ","B00AXTOIJM","B0040JI3M4","B004OL2OKK"]},"categories":[["Books","Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science Fiction","Adventure"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science Fiction"]],"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science Fiction","Adventure"],"avg_rating":{"$numberDouble":"4.296296296296297"},"count_rating":{"$numberInt":"108"},"sum_rating":{"$numberInt":"464"}}

His virtuosity as a writer was his manner of depicting simple things and ordinary people in an intriguing way for the readers. He has a warm and kind understanding for his characters, particularly when describing the intricate details of their dreary routine lives. (Enoch) Arnold Bennett was born in Hanley, Staffordshire, in 1867. Arnold followed his father into the legal profession but at the age of 21, he decided to leave his father's firm and moved to London and worked as a solicitor's clerk. He won a literary competition in &#x22;&#x22;Tit Bits&#x22;&#x22; magazine in 1889 and in 1893 became assistant editor of the journal, Woman. He published his first essentially autobiographical novel The Man from the North in 1898. His best work is contained in his novels of the 'Five Towns' which include Anna of the Five Towns (1902), The Old Wives' Tale (1908), Clayhanger (1910), The Card (1911), Hilda Lessways (1911) and These Twain (1916). During the First World War, he became Director of Propaganda at the War Ministry. He refused a knighthood in 1918. In 1926, he began writing an influential weekly article on books for the Evening Standard newspaper.","price":{"$numberDouble":"0.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41z022n4BJL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B004ULMJ5O","B0013NHLAK","B0078XH8XE","B005H49S8Y","B00HB2HHTC","B005BGCUPG","B008ZQCE9Q","B00IFBDIXC","B005NIO4P6","B004N62GZY","B003BEES9G","B003YCOOYY","B003LSTW3O","B0035FZKTS","B00D6W68KU","B003GXEU90","B00AUJO0RU","B00A4K5BQE","B003YCOP5M","B00BAWX7UW","B005208J8S","B00DN5TYHO","B0054GLEUA","B005BUAFUO","B009JNXCXG","B004HFRKAM","B0058J44QO","B006VXS4TY","B006XXVJI0","B0050W9FZO","B00B5WRXF2","B009583WIU","B008I6JQKS","B0036VO52E","B007QXL378","B004WKR1LK","B003X4M9F4","B00CHXIWVM","B006L14NAA","B002JVWRYU","B008G4Z6I8","B00D2VLXNM","B00AZ089IU","B001CXT84I","B00883UREU","B00DN5U0K4","B002D48LPM","B004E9UB5M","B004LDL9SO","B005586WRW","B00C8X4YHM","B00803FAKE","B00887PC78","B007V4F6ZM","B00AKH61T2","B00EEBZQM8","B007RNDTDI","B00BFMK2PK","B004YTJ4D2","B00BQGFUWU","B00AOG42EA","B00BBJCN9K","B003RCJVE4","B007E3ESWC","B00DN5U66C","B006WQLUBY","B004QZ9X6M","B006UHBLGY","B0092XQLHM","B004OR1G4O","B004NEW21Y","B0081O17WW","B009EE9HZW","B008XOFV8G","B008VM8RFE","B007AWZDWG","B00EADBD7M","B004X36R6G","B000JQUXBQ","B001O222HM","B0042RV1G4"],"buy_after_viewing":["B00II5I9LG","B004GHNIRK","B000JQUXBQ","B004EHZXVQ"]},"categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction","History & Criticism","Criticism & Theory"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Arts & Photography","Theater","History & Criticism"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","History & Criticism","Criticism & Theory"]],"genres":["Criticism & Theory","Theater","Arts & Photography","History & Criticism","Literature & Fiction"],"avg_rating":{"$numberDouble":"4.4"},"count_rating":{"$numberInt":"5"},"sum_rating":{"$numberInt":"22"}}

He was educated at Sydney Grammar School and at the University of Sydney, where he won a scholarship for classics, mathematics and chemistry. He did not complete a course at Sydney, but left for England at the age of 18 and entered St John's College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1876, and in 1877 studied at the University of Berlin. He was secretary of the Society of Hebrew Literature from 1878 to 1884, and in 1882 came into prominence as the writer of a series of articles in The Times on the persecution of the Jews in Russia. This led to the formation of the mansion house fund and committee, of which Jacobs was secretary from 1882 to 1900. During these years he gave much time to anthropological studies in connexion with the Jewish race, and became an authority on the question.&#34;(Quote from wikipedia.org)","price":{"$numberDouble":"0.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61cPvn2PDjL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B003J35KXW","B002M3SXQG","B005FRGD1I","B00CS6P31U","B006RMGXXS","B00BOP6J64","B00C448DL8","B000JQUU00","B006YCEGSK","B004I1KRUK","B005NIYEDI","B006WO6K0W","B004I1KRUA","B00EA1VU5E","B00BDBOFKQ","B00CFRGIEI","B0070YYTPG","B00A3UBR3G","B001AV3WWG","B007K8VKRC","B0037KMGES","B008BJ95M6","B006ZDDGR0","B00C0RZYIE","B00457VJM2","B003DZ1F8K","B0091U1B5I","B00655AQ0S","B000JMLBHU","B000JMLJAE","B004E9U9K4","B001EWEB5I","B006UH4E86","B00A64NSSG","B00DI9D5O8","B003ICWCDK","B008CPE77C","B005JKEMQY","B00C9T41PU","B006RM677K","B004I1KRU0","B00C7QF8UC","B003DZ1FA8","B00CBB6OAQ","B005TLFN4I","B00C3BYDUW","B00DA06W6I","B005F9ZLD2","B004EHZXVQ","B004N625V4","B008G2EEH4","B00AW1BHVI","B004GHNIRK","B00BSBVG1M","B00803FAKE","B00DCD53C2","B004GHNIQQ","B006MN5IKQ","B002RKSEHW","B004NIFSQ6","B00FI7KORE","B008L1LYM8","B00AGZJ01O","B004I1KRTQ","B005H49S8Y","B00BQXMS2I","B008ET3WKO","B007V2LM2A","B006CRC98G","B0039GL2JK","B001QPHNOY","B00CHTEMUG","B00DXXMGWQ","B004E9U97W","B008I6JQKS","B00CC96HF4"],"buy_after_viewing":["B003J35KXW","B0037HOHCA","B0015DWLD0","B00CBB6OAQ"]},"categories":[["Books","Humor & Entertainment","Humor","Sports"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Humor & Entertainment","Humor"]],"author":"Public Domain Books","title":"Indian Fairy Tales","genres":["Humor","Humor & Entertainment","Sports"],"avg_rating":{"$numberDouble":"3.923076923076923"},"count_rating":{"$numberInt":"13"},"sum_rating":{"$numberInt":"51"}}

His first novel was &#x22;The Courage of Captain Plum&#x22; (1908) and he published one or two novels each year thereafter, until his death on August 13, 1927. Owosso residents honor his name to this day, and Curwood Castle (built in 1922) is the town's main tourist attraction. During the 1920s Curwood became one of America's best selling and most highly paid authors. This was the decade of his lasting classics &#x22;The Valley of Silent Men&#x22; (1920) and &#x22;The Flaming Forest&#x22; (1921). He and his wife Ethel loved the outdoors and were active conservationists.","price":{"$numberInt":"0"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CFA0%2BFceL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B0071LTTQC","B00AUADCLO","B00H8USCDW","B00H9DE21O","B00LMZPNI6","B0060GDBI6","B00H8AP5W8","B00HR8PHJC","B00H2M4MD0","B00860MTUK","B00JPOFPS4","B00LA2QDBM","B00H7GTZMO","B004L6293K","B00GKTECJ0","B00KOYB9MK","B00LIEMFKU","B008A9MTCU","B00CCJ5NO0","B00I52PNR0","B00KEFBC1C","B005USIO78","B00I7JK0FG","B007VJ3OPQ","B00E8HWZ36","B0030MIFDE","B00KXFTOWM","B007RNRDVM","B00LBEQ7SI","B0058KTM3S","B00KW3LLA8","B000JMLBHU","B00JYPJPW6","B003L77PZM","B00IV2ZY4G","B00GPSN73S","B002JM0B4W","B000JQULRM","B00L0J8S5E","B000JQUU00","B008UAQPRO","B0089828O6","B00CLZ7K1Y","B002RKSYFE","B00IWUKUVE","B00G5SAVNC","B006SNSP14","B000JMLKI0","B00L9FY4K2","B00IZJLZOI","B00K5GS8OE","B00JYPL8BW","B00KA12CLY","B00L26ZCPE","B00JV6CIEA","B00ISQ8ZZ0","B00JJDXYEI","B00F6YGNYM","B00JTLAL4G","B004GHNIQQ","B004EHZXVQ","B006WB4W2I","B00BWSP3A6","B00HNJ4N0E","B005WE12B0","B004DCBEWY","B00CS6P31U","B00HYPRK52","B004FV4RVS","B00JU73A6K","B00HID7MRQ","B00DXXMGWQ","B005EM2NXG","B00JW2DN6U","B00B5J4T7U","B00KPLKT9Q","B008CA33RM","B00K79D4SY","B000JQUVMC","B00KV0AZVI","B00KJCDPLU","B00AAGLVG6","B004MDLPKA","B003TO68BO","B00JPPUBM8","B002FDLNXI","B004GHNIRK","B006H7Z5D2","B00CRG9WNQ","B002RKRZHW","B0039GL3HQ","B0039GL1HI","B00JCG6T94","B000SN6IOQ","B00CJJ91VE","B000JMLJAE","B0039GL1XM","B000JQUHXA","B00IRDJA12","B008X8G9FQ"],"buy_after_viewing":["B004EHZXVQ","B000JQULRM","B000JMLBHU","B002RKSYFE"]},"categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction","Drama","United States"],["Books","Literature & Fiction","United States","Anthologies"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Drama & Plays","United States"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","United States","Anthologies"]],"genres":["Drama & Plays","Anthologies","United States","Literature & Fiction","Drama"]}

Scott was the first English-language author to have a truly international career in his lifetime, with many contemporary readers in Europe, Australia, and North America. His novels and poetry are still read, and many of his works remain classics of both English-language literature and of Scottish literature. Famous titles include Ivanhoe, Rob Roy, The Lady of the Lake, Waverley, The Heart of Midlothian and The Bride of Lammermoor. -wikipedia","price":{"$numberInt":"0"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41sO65Z2uNL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B00II5I9LG","B008TVLU8I","B00CFRGIEI","B00FE20VIK","B000JQUU00","B004EHZXVQ","B003J35KXW","B004X1XEYG","B00DXXMGWQ","B00EN6LJ2U","B000JMLBHU","B002RKSMHO","B004GHNIRK","B000JQU69K","B009MFTGBS","B00FL7U228","B004GHNIQQ","B000JMLOGI","B002RKSEHW","B00L85UKTW","B000JQUVMC","B00JH02G88","B00L0J8S5E","B00EOAFQVU","B00KJ45PDY","B000JMLJAE","B00CS6P31U","B000JQUHXA","B0039GL1TG","B002RKRUTU","B00IN5W1YC","B0039GL2JK","B000JQV6NA","B0039GL394","B002RKSZJO","B002RKSYFE","B002RKRMSY","B0039GL29U","B000JQUXL6","B000JQTXYE","B00457VJM2","B000JMKZEA","B000JQUSLQ","B000SN6IOQ","B0039GL38K","B002RKRZD6","B000JQUHXK","B000JMLKI0","B002RKT8OA","B00IY5RM04","B002RKRZHW","B0039GL21I","B0039GL2SG","B000JQUHXU","B0039GL2IG","B000JQUTGK","B000JQULRM","B00FCZC2KE","B000JQUPO6","B005VRZXOA","B005MT8U3S","B0039GL2U4","B000SN6J8Q","B000JQUHY4","B0039GL1PA","B002RKS5WG","B0039GL2MM","B000JQTWI6","B002RKT8E0","B000SN6IC8","B0064CPQYS","B0039GL1XM","B0039GL38A","B002RKRT7S","B002RKT124","B0039GL1QY","B0039GL3NU","B000JQUHYE"],"buy_after_viewing":["B004EHZXVQ","B000JQUU00","B000JMLBHU","B004GHNIQQ"]},"categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction","Drama","British & Irish"],["Kindle Store","Kindle Short Reads","Two hours or more (65-100 pages)","Literature & Fiction"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Drama & Plays","British & Irish"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","World Literature","British"]],"genres":["Two hours or more (65-100 pages)","Drama & Plays","World Literature","British","Kindle Short Reads","Literature & Fiction","Drama","British & Irish"]}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecac2b19a853d96389d"},"asin":"B000JQUXL6","description":"Anton Chekhov, in full Anton Pavlovich Chekhov   (born Jan. 29 [Jan. 17, Old Style], 1860, Taganrog, Russia&#x2014;died July 14/15 [July 1/2], 1904, Badenweiler, Ger.), major Russian playwright and master of the modern short story. He was a literary artist of laconic precision who probed below the surface of life, laying bare the secret motives of his characters. Chekhov&#x2019;s best plays and short stories lack complex plots and neat solutions. Concentrating on apparent trivialities, they create a special kind of atmosphere, sometimes termed haunting or lyrical.

Er versuchte sich in mehreren Berufen. Aus dem Wunsch heraus, die praktischen Lebensbedingungen seiner Landsleute zu verbessern, gab er nacheinander mehrere Zeitschriften heraus und verfa&#xDF;te zahlreiche zum Teil satirische ArtikeL Ein heftiger Angriff gegen die religi&#xF6;se Unduldsamkeit der anglikanischen Kirche brachte ihn sogar an den Pranger, wo ihm das Volk jedoch begeistert zujubelte.

Kingsley was born in Islington. She was the daughter of George Kingsley (himself a travel writer) and Mary Bailey, and the niece of Charles Kingsley. Her father was a doctor and worked for George Herbert, 13th Earl of Pembroke. Her mother was an invalid and Mary was expected to stay at home and look after her. Mary had little formal schooling but she did have access to her father's large library and loved to hear her father's stories of foreign countries. Her father died in February 1878. Her mother also died just five weeks later. Freed from her family responsibilities, and with an income of &#xA3;500 a year, Mary was now able to travel.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecac2b19a853d9638df"},"asin":"B000JQV6NA","description":"Frederick Douglass (1818&#x2013;1895) was an American social reformer, orator, writer and statesman. After escaping from slavery, he became a leader of the abolitionist movement, gaining note for his dazzling oratory and incisive antislavery writing. He stood as a living counter-example to slaveholders' arguments that slaves did not have the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens. Many Northerners also found it hard to believe that such a great orator had been a slave. Douglass wrote several autobiographies, eloquently describing his life as a slave, and his struggles to be free. His first autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, was published in 1845 and was his best-known work, influential in gaining support for abolition. He wrote two more autobiographies, with his last, Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, published in 1881 and covering events through and after the Civil War. After the Civil War, Douglass remained active in the United States' struggle to reach its potential as a &#x22;land of the free&#x22;. Douglass actively supported women's suffrage. Following the war, he worked on behalf of equal rights for freedmen, and held multiple public offices. Douglass was a firm believer in the equality of all people, whether black, female, Native American, or recent immigrant.

Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus; two stories with family themes, one coauthored with Kellerman's two daughters (&#x22;The Luck of the Draw&#x22;); and a pair of autobiographical essays, one a poignant tribute to her late father (&#x22;The Summer of My Womanhood&#x22;). Kellerman's short stories may lack the intricate plotting of her novels (Stone Kiss, etc.), but a typical effort like the title story, in which Decker notices some things out of place when a friend dies of an apparent heart attack, is never less than entertaining.

Applying &#x22;early adopter&#x22; buzzwords to Lincoln, Wheeler's inquiry into his use of the telegraph has the spirit of a management consultant appraising a client's leadership style. The author relates that Lincoln personally sent out 1,000 telegrams during the Civil War, learning along the way what was or wasn't effective. Initially an intermittent user, Lincoln at times was so reliant on rapid communication that he spent nights at the War Department's telegraph office. Every Lincoln reader is familiar with this image, and Wheeler taps into this common memory by quoting Lincoln's telegraphic words on these occasions. They group most numerously around specific battles (e.g., 1862's Second Battle of Bull Run) and Lincoln's reprieves of condemned soldiers. Expanding on this footnote to history, Wheeler shows a Lincoln groping for a best-use of new technology and learning the limitations of the &#x22;killer app.&#x22;Gilbert TaylorCopyright &#xa9; American Library Association.

Fearing for their own safety, Rose's family moves back to England. Fifteen years later, Rose is shopping at the market when a strange man thrusts a letter into her basket and, before fleeing, cautions her to guard it with her life. Seeing the seal of Hugo's family on the letter, Rose surmises that it must concern the business of Hugo's cousin, and the veiled message inside indicates a lovers' rendezvous. Soon, however, Rose suspects she's being followed, and with a little investigation finds that her pursuer is Raj Khanna, a handsome Indian businessman, who's after the letter for reasons far graver than romance; amid rising suspense, Rose uncovers a plot to assassinate Queen Victoria and the truth about what happened to her beloved Hugo. Fast-paced, rooted in solid period details and supported by a fine cast of secondary characters&mdash;especially the scrappy street urchins who come to Rose's aid&mdash;Brandewyne's latest is another winning romp.(Dec.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Soap actress Kelly Trent, who plays bitchy advice diva Marla Valentine, is given a lengthy, unsought leave of absence after a number of death threats, some near-lethal &#x22;accidents&#x22; and the murders of three real-life advice therapists. Her consolation prize is a starring role in a music video for the rock group Kill Me Quick, to promote their new song &#x22;Tango to Terror.&#x22; Filming will take place on a private Florida island&mdash;Dead Man's Key. Can it be that Kelly's in danger? She doesn't think so, but her manager does. Enter Doug O'Casey, not-quite-retired private eye and tango instructor. Kelly resents his insistence that she needs his protection, but she's attracted in spite of herself. &#x22;One of the very slow, rueful smiles she found so appealing curled onto his lips.&#x22; Graham introduces enough red herrings to make a seafood salad, while the ending leaves no doubt that Doug and Kelly will exchange rueful smiles forever after.

When the gorgeous blond informs him that she stopped because she had a vision that a man jumped from the overpass, it is the beginning of the end of Jack's bachelorhood. He finds that Opal Smith takes a bit of getting used to, but his tendency to save helpless females keeps him around. Opal is from a family of psychics, all with their own specialty except for her.

And like these songs, the romance between Mallory Edwards and John Barron is at times quaint, humorous,  ironic, touching, and heroic. Mallory's family has always owned Craige Castle, so when financial  circumstances require that Mallory marry to keep the Castle in the family, she does so out of duty. Young  and inexperienced, she is willing to take her mother's advice about relationships. When her new husband  abandons her on their wedding night she makes peace with her new and lonely life until John's debts force  Mallory and her mother out of their family home. Seven years after her wedding night, Mallory goes in  search of her husband, and finds he has much more to offer than financial stability.","price":{"$numberDouble":"25.95"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kehOmunsL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B000MAH73G","B000MAH75E","B000MAH75O","B000MAH74A","B000FC2830","B000MAH74U","B000MAH740","B000OVLJOQ","B002Q1YDAY","B000FC280S","B0037B6QOS","B000UODXKU","B000MAH754","B000JMKOFK","B000FCKB3E","B000FC283A","B004QWZCCE","B0010SKSLM","B006VJN29A","B009NF6Y4O","B001650UC6","B000FC1PNO","B003V1WWAG","B007HBTDCQ","B00DB361Y2","B00DB3621E","B00A9V078A","B006569IV0","B00HPWRYSW","B000FC1PNY","B00KTID5VY","B00K6YYJAC","B00LI91B0K","B00LKNP8DU","B00LNIR6SW","B00JZ29KKK","B001NLKY7O","B00KBSYU52","B00JX12L3G","B00K4MM3U4","B00L9NNXE2","B00KYA4GGA","B00I6ZJ6GK","B00IXTQ4B4","B00LK6TRNO","B00LKQHZTM","B00IXYIRVY","B008CH21GO","B00HOII46S","B00LDEWTMY","B00DB3A89G","B00G97C51K","B00CG8F2A2","B00KUYCF2W","B00L0IMB12","B00HP3POEC","B00L0ITV2Y","B00L3F17F8","B00FJ3ADRI","B00DPM7U1M","B00L4KTTOI","B00KF4BFB4","B009NF6DHC","B00K35PDUE","B00KH961LG","B00A9UZHDQ","B00KUYCF0O","B00CR70RF2","B00HRHB22O","B00JVV3WJ0","B00JT1HP5Y","B00HMXLW9Q","B00DB36D5E","B00K7FVHJQ","B00DB365KW","B00G984VPW","B00L0ITVRY","B00JLBVJHM","B002X4BBL8","B000JMKTT6","B00FBZKZI6","B00CK51IRC","B00KBV5O40","B00L2MQJX2","B009979I76","B000JMKTU0","B00I90VSQ8","B00A9UZHF4","B009NF6YVC","B00FJ34ZUY","B00HFDVMTI","B00CY2OZLW","B00FJ350FS","B00G1K7A9W","B00LDYFG74","B00FG9GUGS","B007HB82SM","B00DXLDGHW","B001NLL8WY","B0098SA93S"],"buy_after_viewing":["B000FC2830","B000MAH73G","B00DB3621E","B001650UC6"]},"categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction"],["Books","Romance","Historical"],["Books","Romance","Western"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Romance","Historical Romance"]],"genres":["Historical","Romance","Western","Literature & Fiction","Historical Romance"],"avg_rating":{"$numberInt":"4"},"count_rating":{"$numberInt":"8"},"sum_rating":{"$numberInt":"32"}}

Such is the case with this remarkably researched history of the Guggenheims. Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winner Irwin Unger (The Greenback Era) and his wife, Debi (coauthor, with Irwin, ofLBJ: A Life), assemble an extraordinary collection of letters, interviews, memos and contemporary documents to tell the story of the family's rapid rise and slow decline, a saga marked by a combination of &#x22;profound Americanism&#x22; and Jewish &#x22;old world heritage.&#x22; The sheer size of the Guggenheim family&mdash;the Ungers note that the &#x22;legion&#x22; descendants of Meyer (1828&ndash;1905), the family patriarch, are &#x22;impossible&#x22; to follow through time&mdash;means that no one member of the clan stands out, though the feisty Harry, &#x22;fighting entropy&#x22; in the family for much of the 20th century, burns brighter than many of his relatives. The scintillating Peggy Guggenheim, known for her patronage of modern art and her robust sex life, gets ample play here, but her story is told more thoroughly in recent biographies by Anton Gill and Mary Dearborn. Readers looking for a broad, appetizing sweep of American life will find it here, but those hungry for sharp, burning flavors may skip to the next course. 16-page b&amp;w photo insert not seen byPW.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

McKechnie's memories of the original musical's creative genesis serve as the centerpiece, and the other chapters are equally compelling. Her story is one of fierce drive and determination. Leaving Detroit at 16, she ran away from home to dance with a touring troupe, arriving in Manhattan at 17. Following a failed audition with American Ballet Theatre, she performed in Massachusetts musicals, filmed commercials and toured inWest Side Story, leaping from the long-run Broadway hitHow to Succeed in Business Without Really Tryingin 1961 to TV (Hullabaloo;Dark Shadows). By the time Stephen Sondheim'sCompanybrought her back to Broadway in 1970, her career was a cakewalk, but the aftermath of a divorce from choreographer Michael Bennett led to a &#x22;vicious circle of depression.&#x22; McKechnie writes honestly, revealing her innermost thoughts, looking back at family, close friends and intimate relationships, while probing her anxieties, low self-esteem and personal pain between the plaudits, raves and theatrical triumphs. 16-page photo insert not seen byPW.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A self-described &#x22;recovery specialist&#x22; (read: thief), Sebastian thinks breaking into the South American home of wealthy antiquities collector Felix Estrada is a simple assignment. But things get complicated quickly when he finds Estrada at home, lying in a pool of blood. Estrada's last breath is a plea for Caine to take care of his &#x22;cat&#x22;&mdash;but a search of the home reveals neither the manuscript Sebastian was hired to recover nor Estrada's wayward feline. Caine soon discovers that &#x22;cat&#x22; is really sexy ethnobotanist Dr. Katelyn Lyda, the old man's niece. Deducing she has the sought-after manuscript, and suspecting that she killed her uncle to get it, Caine tracks down the feisty, frightened Kat in the foothills of the Andes. Despite mutual mistrust, the two become allies after thugs threaten both their lives. As they endeavor to solve Estrada's murder and learn the secrets (and cash value) of a 500-year-old text, the sparks&mdash;both romantic and ballistic&mdash;don't disappoint. Montgomery has a winning pair in morally flexible Sebastian and principled Kat, and the tropical gauntlet she runs them through is twisty and satisfying.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963999"},"asin":"B000NY11RY","description":"In these three erotic novellas about a trio of girlfriends experiencing all that Napa wine country has to offer-especially the men-erotica newcomer Andre (Take Me) makes sure each woman is fiercely her own, complete with convincing backstories and particular neuroses. Prim-and-proper Carrie has just turned down a calculated proposal from one of San Francisco's elite, full-figured Rose has just been dumped for a thinner woman, and sex-obsessed Vanessa is just looking for a little distraction. Scenarios that could easily have been trod with reckless sexual abandon, however, give way to sweet, sensual, empowered stories enveloped in heady romance. Andre scores with her subtle use of Napa Valley food, wine and atmosphere, making her stories that much more delicious. Unfortunately, they all follow the same structure, and it quickly becomes clear that each woman is playing for keeps, not a roll in the hay. Though her erotic possibilities are hedged in by the spicy-but-safe formula, and readers may lose interest before they can finish their second helping, Andre provides some escapist fare for sentimental genre fans.Copyright &#xa9; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

How can these Jehovah's Witnesses persist in their belief that the end of the world is imminent? In this academic study, Holden, a British sociologist, attempts to understand why the strict and austere Watch Tower Society continues to enjoy rapid growth. This is neither a primer on the danger of &#x22;cults&#x22; nor an endorsement of the Witnesses' distinctive beliefs, but a balanced ethnography that draws upon interviews with both adherents and ex-members to help readers understand what it is like to be part of the Society. Holden's main thesis that the Watch Tower is engaged in careful and ongoing negotiations with the secular culture that surrounds it is a nuanced one, especially compared to previous studies that have depicted the movement as little more than an extremist rejection of modernity. The study bears the marks of the dissertation that it once was: it overexplains how data were collected and analyzed, surveys the historiography of the topic (which, as Holden points out, is all but nonexistent in the case of the Witnesses) and relies heavily on a few theorists (in this case, Clifford Geertz and Mary Douglas). But the topic is compelling enough that readers who are interested in the Watch Tower will be obliged to put aside Holden's academese and be grateful for what he has given them: a thoughtful book that takes the Witnesses' own beliefs and words seriously.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.","price":{"$numberDouble":"9.41"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AgeLRjp2L._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_viewed":["B003D3O3YA","B006T46K4Q","B00EO8ACUM","B00B92REHK","B00CRM1WY2","B00JWZJUNM","B00ILWKT32","B00HPYAH52","B00FGUOGSG","B004RQ6IRC","B00EEIWUFW","B00IU6V33O","B00I6MJ3CA","B008LZLHH6","B00B10U4TU","B003Z9JOQO","B00548AJJ0","B00AZNXV6M"],"buy_after_viewing":["B003D3O3YA","B001TBWUD4","B006T46K4Q","B003UYUWX8"]},"categories":[["Books","Business & Money","Marketing & Sales","Marketing"],["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Denominations & Sects","Jehovah's Witness"],["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Living","Business & Professional Growth"],["Books","Religion & Spirituality","Religious Studies","Sociology"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Business & Money","Marketing & Sales","Marketing"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Denominations & Sects","Jehovah's Witness"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Religious Studies & Reference","Sociology"]],"genres":["Jehovah's Witness","Christian Books & Bibles","Marketing","Christian Denominations & Sects","Business & Money","Marketing & Sales","Business & Professional Growth","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Living","Religious Studies & Reference","Sociology","Religious Studies"]}

As in his highly praised first novel (Sons of the City), the Philadelphia Daily News reporter plunges readers directly into Sgt. Eddie North's daily life as a cop in a city riven by racial tension. When Sonny Knight, a powerful African-American city councilman, is found beaten on the streets of West Philadelphia, he accuses the first two white police officers to arrive on the scene of inflicting the damage-and then adds Eddie's name to his list when North answers their call for backup. Eddie knows he's innocent, and neither of his cops appears to have been involved in any violence. But the city's police and political leaders, already under pressure from the controversial case of a radical black college professor charged with killing a white cop, seem less than eager to believe North and his men-especially when one of the accused cops appears to have a hidden history of mayhem. Under investigation by internal affairs, Eddie risks his beloved job and several police department friendships as he tries to come up with reasons for Councilman Knight to have lied about his beating. Flander is especially good at showing how decent people on both sides of a racial quagmire can be dangerously blinkered and how easily hard-won loyalties and friendships can be destroyed.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.","price":{"$numberDouble":"0.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SlywAJRYL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B004GUSI36","B000FCKH2Y","B000FC1RZK","B000FC14DK","B00FI99MWA","B007ZWER9Q","B000FCK6VQ","B006YK7BE8","B00FSPXGZS","B007PVTOEA","B00KMMQT6K","B00BTIMY0Q","B00IOXX6UQ","B00BV9J8I4","B000FC10JI","B00FKLKH70","B007AU8UV4","B00B8R1NP0","B00D209IS0","B00F1HJJJU","B005YSUS1Y","B00E9TY9A0","B00ICBMPDO","B00BTNQFNI","B00D3EK1A4","B003ZSHUIE","B005MRN2B0","B00IYX1YKK","B00FK5VJQ4","B008654RPU","B00GPI2HDE","B0086REQSQ","B00HWMKN8I","B00BH7GLQC","B000FC11II","B00EM9KUZU","B00HZ0QLEW","B00ECSRD3S","B008K7Y47K","B00J1QC2KK","B00HZPVK7U","B00DTIBRWU","B0081BZB4K","B00H7ZC3JW","B00ITFOBIA","B00HANL5HM","B00IAIVVC0","B009HUT316","B00E1IVPB0","B00BGHFD6W","B00J4XVNS2","B002BD2URU","B00JXRCPNG","B003TU1ZIO","B000FCK6W0","B009BCAT5E","B00IZP4K2G","B00GT2UMQU","B00C3LKYZ0","B00D7O7RE8","B00HZNLYQO","B008RCL5B6","B00AWA0XDC","B006KZ7QI8","B002OMZTUS","B00F212VGS","B004XTTVM2","B00876HPZ2","B0047Y0ETW","B00F4F33DC","B00JUPQVX6","B009HB3PSW","B00K39Q7ZK","B00CLWVLMG","B002OMZTYE","B0091I2IH0","B009WJWD2S","B002OMZTTE","B00CK12J6A","B008Q3VO58","B0044UHEPG","B004XTXIP8","B00DRLACCA","B00DC2RBJQ","B00H9HBYQ6","B00K0OP6VE","B00505DSFO","B0028AEFOM","B005A7SVS6","B00IOYDAEW","B00H4E568Q","B00D2LYA6Y","B00BN7P8D8","B006WRFO2O"],"buy_after_viewing":["B000FC1RZK","B000FC14DK","B004GUSI36","B000FCKH2Y"]},"categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction"],["Books","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Mystery"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Mystery"]],"genres":["Mystery","Literature & Fiction","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense"]}

Believing Yucatan chicle&#x92;s rubber-like qualities could launch a rubber tire industry, the ambitious Santa Anna struck a deal with inventor Thomas Adams. Failing to concoct a rubber substitute from the springy sap, Adams instead succeeded with his licorice-flavored Black Jack gum. Consumers went wild, and other entrepreneurs leaped in, including, in 1893, William Wrigley. With free gum samples mailed to millions, Wrigley&#x92;s innovative ad campaigns made him one of America&#x92;s 10 wealthiest men. His factories produced 280 million sticks of gum weekly, which had far-reaching implications in the Yucatan jungles: &#x22;The production and sale of chicle on the part of rebel Mayas Indians... was allowing them to buy arms to fight the Mexican government.&#x22; American gum manufacturers were dependent on supplies from land controlled by the Mayan rebels, and since &#x22;the geopolitics of hemispheric relations lies at the heart of the story of chewing gum,&#x22; the book has 75 pages on military conflicts, impoverished forest workers, the chicle economy and international harvesting and production methods. With gum added to WWII service rations, 150 billion sticks were shipped overseas, but bubble gum synthetics brought the era of Mayan-harvested chicle to a close. While some readers may be interested in the book&#x92;s concluding chapters (which cover abandoned chicle camps, tourism possibilities and renewed interest in chicle for natural organic products), the omission of Bazooka&#x92;s contribution to the chewing gum world, as well as the book&#x92;s overall dry tone, take away from this book&#x92;s general appeal.

As time ticks down in short snippets, lengthy flashbacks depict the hunt for a newly resurfaced serial killer thought imprisoned decades ago. While Zach and partner Terry investigate the convict originally held responsible for the crimes, a former suspect and his daughter cope with the media spotlight, retrained on them following the new round of killings, and what may be the watchful gaze of the killer himself. Despite some bland dialogue and generic, B-movie-ready characters&mdash;wise-cracking buddy lawyers, a riddling serial killer, an enigmatic crime boss&mdash;Gaffney jerks the plot in enough different directions to keep readers alert and entertained. In addition, Gaffney's dry wit and willingness to make light of his more absurd plot twists keep this over-the-top stunner afloat when it threatens to capsize. The legal thriller equivalent of a James Bond flick, this guilty pleasure is best enjoyed with the more discerning half of the brain turned off and the adrenaline turned all the way up.(Apr.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Rather, the author helps readers delve into their personal histories to discover what turns them on (and off) and how to communicate these revelations to a partner. Bogart, a lecturer and professor, employs worksheets, charts, quizzes and checklists as prompts for readers to reflect on past sexual experiences and to describe what worked and what didn't; these self-assessment questions range from &#x22;Describe your first kissing experience&#x22; to selecting a response that best describes the reader's views on group sex, role-playing and watching pornography. Bogart dishes advice alongside whimsical illustrations depicting body parts and techniques (such as &#x22;Using a dental dam&#x22;) and testimonials from individuals of all ages, genders and sexual orientations. It's clear from chapter titles such as &#x22;A Penile Pilgrimage&#x22; and &#x22;Voyage to the Land of Vulvas and Vaginas&#x22; that Bogart considers sex a journey, rather than something to be conquered or achieved, and this book is a viable road map for curious explorers in search of uncharted sexual terrain.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But Gentry is not a lightweight pop author; he is editor in chief of the Journal of Behavioral Medicine, and has been working with victims of what he calls &#x22;toxic&#x22; anger (&#x22;anger that is experienced far too often, is far too intense and lasts far too long&#x22;) for decades. Believable case studies illustrate how Gentry&#x92;s seven steps can work, and he accepts the irrationality of the love that makes people reluctant to leave such relationships (though if the other steps fail, he advises, it may be necessary to leave). Questionnaires and tables help readers evaluate their situation and answer such questions as &#x22;how angry is too angry?&#x22; He then offers sensible, tested steps, not to change the angry person, but to manage the anger and one&#x92;s response to it, such as getting a support network and controlling one&#x92;s own anger.

Though none of his ideas are new, Davis presents them with a winning blend of warmth and affability. While he does not work with his titular metaphor until the end of the book, Davis deals with topics such as suffering, loss and disappointment throughout, peppering the book with anecdotes (and miracles) from his own life as well as the lives of friends, celebrities and people to whom he has ministered. In particular, Davis refers repeatedly to his own son's deafness, and as he tells stories about this situation, he displays a refreshing combination of honesty, humility, optimism and faith. This attitude toward his own pain not only strengthens his credibility as an adviser to the suffering but also sets the book apart; unlike most authors who tackle these topics, Davis yields a book infused with lightness that does not actually make light of the serious topics it covers. As an evangelical Christian, Davis performs a difficult balancing act: He refers more than once to the uniqueness of Christ, but also encourages people of all faiths to look to their own religions for solace and moral guidance. Evangelical readers may judge this an unacceptable compromise, but Davis's wider audience will undoubtedly appreciate the gesture.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.","categories":[["Books","Children's Books"],["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Living","Self Help"],["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Protestantism"],["Books","Religion & Spirituality","Spirituality","Inspirational"],["Books","Self-Help","Motivational"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Children's eBooks"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Health, Fitness & Dieting"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Living","Self-Help"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Protestantism"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Spirituality","Inspirational","Personal Testimonies"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Self-Help","Motivational"]],"genres":["Children's Books","Spirituality","Self Help","Personal Testimonies","Christian Books & Bibles","Health, Fitness & Dieting","Motivational","Inspirational","Protestantism","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Living","Children's eBooks","Self-Help"]}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d9639fa"},"asin":"B000OIZSSC","description":"Based on more than 1000 hours of secretly recorded  conversations, this book tells the story of New Jersey's  DeCavalcante crime family. Originally dismissed by the large New  York City crime organizations, the DeCavalcantes sought the  opportunity to move up in the crime world when their big-city counterparts began having legal troubles and when The Sopranos,  which recounts the life of a fictional Jersey mob family, became  such a hit on HBO. Unfortunately for the DeCavalcantes, they had  been infiltrated by an FBI informant. Although the show's  creator has denied it, much of The Sopranos is said to be based  on this real-life crime family, and DeCavalcante members were  even caught on federal wiretaps bragging about their similarity  to the TV mobsters. But while Daily News mob reporter Smith  draws many parallels between the DeCavalcantes and the fictional  Sopranos, the book does not quite live up to its potential. Much  of the writing seems disjointed and repetitious, and a few  superfluous anecdotes scattered throughout seem to have little  relevance to the rest of the story. Recommended with  reservations for large public libraries where there is a strong  interest in organized crime books.Sarah Jent, Univ. of  Louisville Lib., KYCopyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.","price":{"$numberDouble":"5.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DbTqjO7fL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B002QHATU6","B007IX6TVG","B00EB2QDB8","B004INHW0Q","B004T4KRCY","B009NG0SIG","B004NEW4YY","B004T4KKM6","B001R4CCYU","B00C74VCC2","B003GY0KK2","B002WVGEBO","B003BIGGQA","B005DB7RU2","B002PEP4S2","B003P9XCX0","B0058J44QO","B00A31OW4G","B00H4JHGPM","B00BUUITES","B002BY77BS","B002VQ7PXQ","B002QJZ9XG","B004ELANV2","B0015DPXL2","B001OOLE7E","B005GKIYFW","B00CVNNP0Q","B00BDQ3AVQ","B00182HLN8","B00BCG1MJY","B009CGA74M","B00H8CZCKG","B00A6Z1SUK","B00GL3HMCE","B007JOWZTE","B00B0WHTJW","B004D4Y1TA","B0057AN2DK","B001M0BUJM","B002LA09J4","B000FC29JI","B006H99D1U","B00737RGYQ","B00C799FRG","B000SEIII4","B001NLKSI4","B0084H8BUW","B000W5MI12","B003K16PS2","B006MJFKPS","B0022Q8CSC","B005S0KGGU","B004FN1U9I","B009S33I68","B000FC1I4K","B0029XXT68","B0055POBIM","B000FBJG04","B005KV2L6K","B00EO9GEOE","B0030CVQ94","B008RVARZM","B00A4L7DIW","B00DPM7ZH6","B004J4WM8G","B004LZ575I","B000VMBXD0","B0094G049S","B0087GIRWC","B00134XEQE","B00B76FFG0","B002QX44I8","B0051XSAB2","B008X7FN18","B0064XIWMU","B002UM5BZ0","B002C949J0","B00ALIMTGY","B005I57NZM"],"buy_after_viewing":["B004INHW0Q","B007IX6TVG","B004NEW4YY"]},"categories":[["Books","Biographies & Memoirs","True Crime","Murder & Mayhem"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Biographies & Memoirs","True Accounts","True Crime"]],"genres":["True Accounts","Biographies & Memoirs","True Crime","Murder & Mayhem"]}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963a11"},"asin":"B000OT80M2","description":"When one mentions the word &#x22;statistics&#x22; most of us medical students will give a groan. Medical statistics is known to be challenging and not to mention dull. This book was designed to provide the knowledge of statistics for a wide range of healthcare professionals from medical students to doctors sitting their postgraduate exams. This book helps medical students understand the basic concepts of medical statistics starting in a &#x22;step-by-step approach&#x22;. The authors have designed the book assuming that the reader has no prior knowledge. It focuses on the most common statistical concepts that are likely to be faced in medical literature. All chapters are concise and simple to understand. Each chapter starts with an introduction which consists of &#x22;how important&#x22; that particular statistical concept is, using a &#x22;star&#x22; system. A &#x22;thumbs-up&#x22; system shows how easy the statistical concept is to understand. Both these systems indicate time-efficient learning allowing yourself to focus on areas you find most difficult. Following this, there are worked out examples with exam-tips at the end of some chapters. The last chapter &#x22;Statistics at Work&#x22; shows how medical statistics is put into practice using worked out examples from renowned journals. This helps in assessing the reader's own knowledge and gives them confidence in analysis of statistics of a journal. In conclusion, we would recommend this book as an introduction into medical statistics before plunging into the deep &#x22;statistical&#x22; waters! It gives confidence to the reader in taking up the challenge of understanding statistics and [being] able to apply knowledge in analysing medical literature. To be honest, medical statistics is not a common book that a medical student will pick up, but if one has keen interest he/she will find it interesting and engaging as it is a simple read -- Stefanie Zhao Lin Lip & Louise Murchison Scottish Medical Journal 20100621 I don't own a copy of the original edition of this book; in fact I've not even seen a copy so I am unable to comment on how much better or worse this edition is in comparison. What I can comment on, however, is how utterly grief stricken I am having realised half way through life that such a book exists! It verges on being the Holy Grail for Idiots! If ever there was a book that completely lived up to its title, this is it. The first three pages are devoted to explaining how to even use the book (not many things are made that easy), and the next couple explain the design of the book. I almost feel that I should merely compile a list of excellent features this book exhibits but space would clearly not allow so I'll concentrate on a select, but by no means exhaustive few. There are eight sections divided into a total of 24 chapters (unfortunately none of these are numbered - a minor drawback), each of which tackles a particular aspect of statistics or statistical test. The first chapter, for example, looks at percentages and this is then followed by chapters on Mean, Mode and Median and so the book goes on, passing through p values, t tests, regression, odds ratio, survival analysis, etc, etc. Everything is covered. Perhaps above everything, it is the chapter layout and design that makes this book stand out head and shoulders above the crowd. At the beginning of each chapter two questions are posed - how important is the subject in question and how difficult is it to understand. The first is answered on the basis of how often the subject is mentioned / used in papers published in mainstream medical journals. A star rating is then given from one to five with five stars implying use in the majority of papers published. The second question is answered by means of a 'thumbs up' grading system. The more thumbs, the easier the concept is to understand (maximum of five). This, of course, provides a route into statistics for even the most idle of uneducated individuals! Five stars and five thumbs must surely indicate time-efficient learning! Chapters then continue to follow a uniform format with short paragraphs explaining what each particular aspect means and when it is used. Common pitfalls are also explained and highlighted boxed examples are given in each case. At the end of each chapter exam tips (light bulb icon!) are given - I doubt anyone could ask for more! The whole way in which the authors have written this book is commendable; the chapters are succinct,easy to follow and a pleasure to read. Even the total lack of colour doesn't seem to detract from the excellence of this book, it really is brilliant and the glossary at the back of the book must surely be capable of ensuring a couple of extra marks in the FRCS (Urol) written paper. Is it value for money - a definite yes even at twice the price. Of course I never exaggerate but if you breathe, you should own this book! -- Ian Pearce Urology News 20100615","price":{"$numberDouble":"5.38"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BX7qpm-CL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B005D7EUBA","B000WLKJ08","B004RM9VSY","B0080Y9OF0","B00DX1BUMU","B00B9RJ5HM","B008FAUZ5M","B0066SM80A","B004X75OFM","B0032JTW3W","B00DBER4B0","B00C3XJMQU","B0083JC0Q2","B00CD900GU","B0054RFZGI","B00CP8A4OW","B0054NUBA2","B00400NHRO","B00BPW3Z2C","B008LP8QE8","B008OKFDMS","B004YKW1WC","B001C4MZ56","B00AFUO8BC","B005707JRA","B005H0C8JE","B007C738EE","B008EROFSE","B00FNWFFDC","B00AKE1QUE","B005LB03C8","B007Q6XLF2","B009Y8S6OG","B00C1IBJS6","B005CYWM7S","B00BGZGR32","B00C81R08Y","B0071MFIUC","B007USH7J2","B005WV2Q86","B00B1TJO10","B00924B5S6","B003N19DQA","B007P3AFAU","B004GXATEO","B004HD4UCU"],"buy_after_viewing":["B00C3XJMQU","B00DX1BUMU","B0066SM80A","B008FAUZ5M"]},"categories":[["Books","Medical Books","Administration & Medicine Economics","Medical History & Records"],["Books","Medical Books","Medicine","Internal Medicine","Cardiology"],["Books","Medical Books","Medicine","Internal Medicine","Pathology","Diseases","Cardiovascular"],["Books","Medical Books","Nursing","Reference"],["Books","Medical Books","Research"],["Books","Reference"],["Books","Science & Math","Biological Sciences","Biology","Biostatistics"],["Books","Science & Math","Biological Sciences","Biotechnology"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Medical eBooks","Administration & Policy","Medical History & Records"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Medical eBooks","Internal Medicine","Cardiology"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Medical eBooks","Research"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Medical eBooks","Special Topics","Biotechnology"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Professional Science","Biological Sciences","Biostatistics"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Professional Science","Biological Sciences","Biotechnology"]],"genres":["Special Topics","Medicine","Reference","Administration & Policy","Cardiology","Professional Science","Biotechnology","Professional & Technical","Administration & Medicine Economics","Cardiovascular","Nursing","Research","Biology","Medical History & Records","Medical Books","Diseases","Biological Sciences","Pathology","Science & Math","Medical eBooks","Biostatistics","Internal Medicine"]}

Elkins (Sch. of the Art Inst. of  Chicago; What Painting Is) asks why some people cry in front of  paintings. Using both historical sources and solicited examples,  he spins out various generally unconvincing hypotheses.  Admitting that he himself has never cried in front of a  painting, Elkins fails to get to the heart of the matter. Noting  that other forms of expression (theater, music, novels, film)  are more likely to elicit tears, Elkins attempts to explain  their absence in our own time as a peculiarity of the 20th  century. The examples of contemporary tears that Elkins resents  are largely self-selected (solicited through ads in various  publications) and neither prove nor disprove his theories. A  rambling and often obtuse style makes this already rather  intangible topic even more slippery. Art Matters is recommended  for academic and public libraries with a demand for art theory;  Pictures and Tears is not recommended. Martin R. Kalfatovic,  Smithsonian Inst.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963a6a"},"asin":"B000P46RYE","description":"Young adults will best appreciate this light, sentimental fantasy about the gargoyles who watch over the churches of Dublin, whether Catholic, Protestant or deconsecrated, from bestselling veteran Kurtz (the Deryni series, etc.). More mature readers, on the other hand, may be put off by the simplistic story and the slack pace. The city's gargoyles meet monthly on a moonless night and, like good Irishmen, bemoan change and the loss of the good old days. When vandals break into St. Patrick's Church, Paddy, its resident gargoyle, calls on old Templeton, a Knight of Malta who drives an ancient Rolls Royce for weddings, to help him apprehend the miscreants. Paddy also brings to life the Rolls Royce's hood ornament, which Templeton tells him is a gryphon, not a gargoyle. Investigating the scene of the crime with his thirtyish policeman godson, Marcus Cassidy, Templeton finds Death's Deputy at the church, expecting his due. In a nice touch, Paddy argues with the deputy to allow the old man more time to discover who's behind the break-in. Heavy in its piety and exposition of Celtic history, this novel is a determined tourist guide to Dublin sites; however, James Joyce did some of the same thing, and Ulysses is still going strong.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.","price":{"$numberDouble":"5.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51g2-Xi4hSL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B0068TM4P6","B0076DH0X4","B005Y4FFK2","B00INIXVSO","B00INIYFWK","B001JOHCI4","B000Q9INCM","B001GUXJMO","B001HD8NZS","B0010JWVI4","B001N89L76","B00JOOQHVE","B000W93DTO","B000OIZU5S","B00IXX4IZE","B00JOOQE1M","B00KQNVB54","B00J1HNK3W","B00JOOQE12","B00JOOQHH8","B00287KD0K","B00287KD78","B006ATJX4Y","B002OFVNMS","B00HXZZXV6","B00IV9JF6M","B00GET1FTQ","B00HNIARLE","B00CHQOVUU","B0041KLEVY","B00H1294UW","B00JCZQVF2","B00DMCPROM","B00INIXUOY","B00F8N8GOG","B00IJMIFE4","B00APAEKFQ","B00AP91PIC","B00IPZYJG8","B00AYJIL30","B000RH0E70","B00F9F0UZG","B008UCJ67I","B004TGTFW0","B00APA4PCO","B000FBFOK0","B00APA4HCM","B00AP9CMWU","B00B1FG8BS","B00AP9CKDG","B00APA46EQ","B00APADQWE","B00AP9XNPK","B000FBFOJQ","B00FCQQDPI","B009MQQJDU","B000FBFMZM","B00DFLFXTY","B007P7HRV6","B000FBFOKA","B00APAH8XC","B002JA02JS","B000MAH76S","B002J05GSK","B009VMC1FA","B00C8U163U","B001UFP4TG","B005OCYQW2","B00APACV0C","B001AO0FMI","B00BEQZU4A","B00FX7RFL2","B00APACAX0","B00AP91W76","B002IEUV4G","B00BEQP040","B005V220K0","B002SV379A","B00AP9CUWM","B0073XV3TO","B002J05GXU","B00AP987T2","B00BLSYB5U","B004FPYZ8Y","B004G8Q182","B004G8PYJE","B00CLFCFVY","B00APADZKW","B002J05GZS","B003U89RVM","B000FBFOCI","B00APAH4YU","B0017T09XG","B0040SYIZG","B00APAHXVY","B00APAEID0","B00BGCC28Y","B0046ECFLI","B00AP91V0Y"],"buy_after_viewing":["B0076DH0X4","B005Y4FFK2","B00INIXVSO","B0010JWVI4"]},"categories":[["Books","Children's Books"],["Books","Literature & Fiction","Contemporary"],["Books","Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy","Paranormal & Urban"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Children's eBooks"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Contemporary Fiction","Fantasy"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy","Paranormal & Urban"]],"genres":["Children's Books","Paranormal & Urban","Fantasy","Contemporary Fiction","Science Fiction & Fantasy","Children's eBooks","Contemporary","Literature & Fiction"]}

Noah isn't eager to take on new clients, but he's moved by Peter Pluto's pleas to find younger brother Linc, a college student, whose apartment turns out to contain a stash of guns. The tension escalates when Linc's neighbor is shot after being questioned by Noah. Soon after, Noah's untimely arrival at Peter's ransacked house in a quiet cul-de-sac irritates a couple of vicious skinheads. Noah awakes in a ravine, left for dead, and a bit too cozy with Peter Pluto's corpse. Later, accompanied by his pal Carter, conveniently six-foot-nine, Noah boldly wades into plenty of life-and-limb&#x22;threatening situations, including verboten gang territory and a secluded skinhead gathering.

This one isn't. And my goodness doesn't it show. The prose sings, the story flows effortlessly, and the exposition is refreshingly centred on humanitarian aspects. The character, lifestyle, social context, and motivation of the subject spring into life. The book is an absolute joy, not only for its insight into the accomplishments of one of the world's greatest scientists, but also for its historic review of the scientific turmoil caused by relegating planet Earth from its religious and philosophical position at the centre of the cosmos to its present-day role as a rather insignificant member of the Sun's family of eight planets.The Observatory: a review of astronomy, vol. 126, no. 1190, p. 55 (Feb. 2006) [by David W. Hughes].[...] Naess weaves an excellent account of the story of Galileo. Addressed to the sophisticated general reader, it is an account that is alive, articulate, and well constructed, and one that provides the important larger context that surrounds the drama itself. This reviewer recommends it highly to anyone interested in a succinct and comprehensive look at the &#x22;saga&#x22; of Galileo.MAA Online book review columne, Alexander J. Hahn, October 2005&#xA0;The complete review can be found here:&#xA0;http://www.maa.org/reviews/naessgalileo.html[...] Atle Naess knows how to write a readable book. He wastes no time on padding. He weaves the history, the personalities and the technicalities together expertly, with a sure eye for an interesting detail and an ability to cut through the myths, propaganda and speculation that surround the Galileo case.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963a7c"},"asin":"B000PDYVKW","description":"Starred Review.Lacking clear archeological evidence or extrabiblical testimony, biblical scholars are often challenged in persuading a skeptical world that the Bible's characters really existed and that their stories are actual historical records. The task of separating myth from history can be a daunting one. Finkelstein and Silberman, both renowned archaeologists (Finkelstein chairs the archaeology department [at Tel Aviv University; Silberman is a contributing editor to Archaeology magazine), take a different approach: integrating ancient heroic and warrior archetypes into the lives of the kings of Israel, thus synthesizing history and myth in support of the religious endeavor. The authors are careful to note that the absence of contemporary confirmation outside the Bible is no reason to believe that the characters did not actually exist. Rather, the biblical stories form the basis for a legend tradition in which the Davidic legacy gradually transforms &#x22;from a down-to-earth political program into the symbols of a transcendent religious faith that would spread throughout the world.&#x22; Finkelstein and Silberman, who also had a winner withThe Bible Unearthed, tell their story in a clear and easily understood manner, never boring but always challenging.Discovery Club main selection, BOMC, QPB and History book clubs alternate selection.

The 670 alphabetically arranged entries, written by scholars and experts, range from 1 to 10 pages and explore various aspects of radio broadcasting within radio's historical context. Types of entries include programs (The Green Hornet), people (Keillor, Garrison), networks and organizations (National Broadcasting Company), regulations and policies (Equal Time Rule), audience research (RADAR), evolving technology (Internet radio), radio stations (KYW), and radio's interaction with other societal forces (Violence and radio). Some entries are accompanied by one of 200 black-and-white photographs. The encyclopedia's scope is international, but treatment of non-U.S. radio is often done in broad surveylike entries such asAfrica, Asia,andNew Zealand. The majority of entries emphasize U.S. radio practices, with a secondary emphasis on key English-speaking nations like Britain and Canada.A substantial general annotated bibliography precedes the entries, and within each entry is a bibliography for further reading. The index is fairly comprehensive but could be expanded even more to accommodate geographical interests. For example, it would help to list entries for individual radio stations under the cities in which they are located.Several competent encyclopedias already exist with information on American radio programs and their performers, such as Luther Sies'Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920-1960(McFarland, 2000) andOn the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio(Oxford, 1998), also covering the &#x22;golden age&#x22; of radio. These are more inclusive of the less well known but lack the biographical details inMuseum of Broadcast Communicationsand the scholarly yet accessible narrative bent that places each entry in its broader context.The Encyclopedia of American Radio: An A-Z Guide to Radio from Jack Benny to Howard Stern(Facts On File, 2000) covers recent years but has shorter entries and lacks the international scope of the current encyclopedia. The new encyclopedia is a major addition to radio reference works. It makes a fantastic complement to a detailed radio program chronicler, but it can also stand alone. If libraries can only afford one major reference work on radio, this is the best choice. Enthusiastically recommended for academic and public libraries.RBBCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

The 128 entries range in length from 400 to 4000 words, and include biographies of women from all regions of the U.S. Well-known figures such as Harriet Tubman, Clara Barton, Louisa May Alcott, and Mary Todd Lincoln are represented but so too are African-American sculptor Edmonia Lewis, poet Lucy Larcom, and Emma LeConte, whose Civil War diary is &#x22;one of the clearest articulations of the patriotic ideals and emotions of Southern white girls and women who clung to their faith in the future of the Confederacy.&#x22; As well as biographies, there are superb thematic entries on women living in the West, prostitutes, industrial workers, family life, and invasion and occupation. Discussions of such events as the New York Draft Riot of 1863 or the Battle at Gettysburg explain the role of women or the event's consequences in regard to women's lives. Much of the information came from primary sources, especially diaries, and students are sure to find them fascinating. A few black-and-white photographs are included. Cross-references direct readers to related articles. Each entry is followed by a short list of suggested readings.

He's lived in fifteen different towns in six different New Jersey counties. He has spent over twenty years covering the state as a reporter and editor. Who better to take readers on a very personal tour of the backroads of New Jersey?InBackroads, New Jersey, Di Ionno leads readers off the congested interstates to the seldom-explored secondary roads, where the real life of the state can be found. These intercounty or 500 series roads are a 6,788-mile network of mostly one-lane highways. They are never the most direct way to get anywhere-but they are a pleasure to drive and a way to see New Jersey life as lived by New Jerseyans.Travel with Di Ionno as he takes us to see the state's amazing beauty-from the dizzying cliffs of the Palisades, to the blunted peaks of the Highlands and Kittatinny Ridges, to the rolling hills of Morris, Hunterdon, and Somerset counties, to the topsoil-wealthy agricultural belts of Monmouth and the southern counties, to the flat, sandy beaches of the Jersey Shore. Di Ionno calls New Jersey &#x22;a place of infinite natural beauty, a place of intricate human patterns. A place where you can see a lot in a little time. New Jersey is a restless state for restless people. A state for wanderers to explore.&#x22; Backroads, New Jersey is a rare chance to see it all through the eyes and experiences of a well-traveled Jerseyan.","genres":["Travel","Mid Atlantic","Northeast","Regions","Road Travel","United States","Food, Lodging & Transportation"]}

Don't! As 83-year-old Reese Palley defiantly proclaims inCall of the Ancient Mariner, sailing is the natural sport of the old, the best way to lengthen and improve your life, and the perfect antidote to a society that conspires to restrict the horizons of anyone with a gray hair or two.Palley believes, passionately, that you can and should keep sailing through your golden years. This book is his soapbox, and his message is eloquent, urgent, funny, irreverent, unapologetic and life-affirming. Older sailors are better sailors, he insists, and supports the claim with a dozen inspiring portraits of modern-day ancient mariners interspersed throughout the book.Reese Palley is an orator, haranguer, and cheerleader bent on enriching your life, but he is also a first-class coach. With the hard-won wisdom and practical knowledge of one who has been there (and stillisthere), he addresses your concerns about the physical demands of sailing, safety issues, sailing long distances with a medical condition, preparing for emergencies, and much more.Call of the Ancient Marinerdelivers the encouragement and know-how you need to keep your sea legs under you and enjoy smooth sailing for years to come.A manifesto for all fellow ancient mariners&#x22;People die these days as much from boredom and irrelevance as from disease. Antiquarian depression is pandemic in America. To help others avoid so depressing a fate, this handbook shares with the reader the experiences of this Ancient Mariner. There are obvious adjustments to be made as physical and mental facilities alter and falter. Herein are tips and tricks to keep you sailing decades after you might have thought you were through with the sea. For a sailor, being through with the sea is like being through with life itself. 'Choose life' and continue to choose the sea.&#x22;--fromCall of the Ancient Mariner","genres":["Sailing","Water Sports","Sports & Outdoors"]}

By focusing on your appetite for risk-taking, your ability to manage and adapt to risk, and your pathological patterns of risk-taking, Kiev shows you how to overcome the psychological obstacles of risk that undermine your decision-making process and ability to cut losing trades and stick with winners.With the help of numerous trading case studies, Kiev outlines a risk management program that bridges the gap between investor psychology and quantitative risk management techniques. Filled with expert advice and examples of real market situations, The Psychology of Risk allows you to take action in the face of uncertainty and unpredictability by addressing issues such as:* Risk and the trading approaches you need to deal with it* Psychological techniques that will help you trade independently of emotions: excitement, anger, fear, and stress* Handling problematic behaviors such as perfectionism, decision paralysis, hoarding, and impulsiveness* Handling failure and success* Using the tools of coaching, teamwork, and system building to overcome obstaclesRisk taking does not mean living dangerously; it shows a willingness to act beyond the circle of what you already know. In breaking from the natural inclination to &#x22;avoid risk at all costs,&#x22; you will begin to see risk in a new light-certainly not always as a negative force. The step-by-step approach presented in The Psychology of Risk will provide you with a new and stimulating perspective on risk, which will enhance your trading success and increase your profits.","price":{"$numberDouble":"47.78"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410ANCpORiL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B000U5M2ZG","B008NBZ64S","B001BP3O0G","B00BW54XVO","B0023SDQRG","B007YGGOVM","B00DF1L98S","B006X50OPW","B00DGA8LZC","B00DF0E83W","B004H4XKZM","B000QEVMDO","B000WCWV0I","B000FC2OO8","B00DOSTEVG","B00H7JE8W8","B000PY4URK","B000FCJZ3G","B00DW7PLLQ","B009UG7DCS","B00BGFWOFW","B004H1TBCG","B00DAIOL0E","B004BKJB78","B0088ETCOA","B00F4P0OWA","B002XGICBI","B00ACC69E2","B0067PZ87C","B008L03WWE","B006AX6ONI","B000QTEA4C","B00444424S","B005GSYZRA","B007STBH58","B004X6SK0E"],"buy_after_viewing":["B000U5M2ZG"]},"categories":[["Books","Business & Money","Finance"],["Books","Business & Money","Investing"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Business & Money","Finance"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Business & Money","Investing"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Accounting & Finance","Finance"]],"genres":["Finance","Accounting & Finance","Investing","Business & Money","Professional & Technical"]}

On a somewhat autobiographical note, which Glise uses in her novel, she was given Osborne Russell's Journal of a Trapper years ago. &#x22;As I moved over the years I would always come across Russell's Journal and face the question, keep it or discard? I could never let it go.&#x22; Her fascination with Russell and other men of the Rocky Mountain fur trade led her to new friendships as she conducted the extensive research essential to historical fiction. &#x22;The more I learned, the more overwhelmed I became by what I didn't know. At one point I had an almost paralyzing fear that I was going to make an honest mistake but, nonetheless, a mistake and I would make a fool of myself. I have met extraordinary individuals over the last few years. They generously shared their knowledge and enthusiasm for this incredible time in our nation's history.&#x22; Her desire for accuracy took her to the original 1838 Rendezvous site near present-day Riverton, Wyoming. &#x22;When I showed up that first summer, I am sure the organizers thought I was more qualified to write 'hysterical' fiction. I was a real greenhorn, as Osborne Russell would have referred to me. The 1838 Rendezvous Association has welcomed me with genuine hospitality over the years. I am looking forward to returning in July to participate in the annual reenactment and sign copies of my novel.&#x22; Glise was born and raised in Texas and moved to Tennessee where she earned a B.F.A. in painting, printmaking and sculpture from the University of Memphis. She met and married her husband at MSU and moved to Newnan, Georgia in 1981. Glise earned a M.Ed. in media education from the State University of West Georgia in 1992. She has worked as a media specialist for six years. After she finished her novel in 1999, she and her family moved to Washington. She presently lives in Olympia, Washington with her husband and daughter. Glise is a member of the American Association of University Women, the American Library Association, Washington Education Association, National Education Association, the Washington Library Media Association, and Women Writing the West.

It's a stodgy but effective effort in which an inefficient, disorganized widget-producing outfit called Essential resolves a dire companywide communication problem just in time to avoid corporate disaster. Paul and Cox's approach is to create a series of high-level managerial characters with stereotypical business personalities. The huge cast includes Rick Riggins, the authoritarian &#x22;get it done now&#x22; company president; Frank Harlan, the egotistical, turf-protecting genius engineer; and Jake Foster, a slow-but-steady operations manager new to the company. Essential is about to lose its biggest client because the company can't deliver its widgets on time. The desperate Riggins hires a wise consultant named George Tracey, who guides the company through the revitalization process, starting with candid employee interviews followed by a weekend brainstorming session and a retreat. Paul and Cox do a solid job of creating believable business problems and interpersonal conflicts, though the story is broken up by having too many employees take a turn narrating in short, choppy sections.

The procedures are applicable to well known problems in computational stochastic mechanics, such as the stability analysis of systems with random imperfections and the dynamic analysis of deterministic systems under stochastic loading. For the dynamic analysis of deterministic systems under stochastic loading, an efficient procedure based on the Karhunen-Lo&#xE8;ve representation of the response is presented.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963ae0"},"asin":"B000PY49IA","description":"The role of the chairman of the board is unlike any other in the modern corporation, one that requires a simultaneous grasp of the big and small picture. The chairman exerts extraordinary influence over the strategic direction of the company, yet at the same time must manage the delicate relationships and critical business of the board of directors. Remarkably, precious little research has been conducted into the nature of chairmanship, and most chairmen are forced to learn on the job, with no training or formal preparation. Writing primarily for new chairmen, chairmen of small to midsize businesses, and chairmen in the nonprofit sector, while also offering practical guidance to seasoned leaders of major corporations, Brian Lechem provides a fascinating look at the essential duties of this pivotal role in Chairman of the Board: A Practical Guide.As companies become more and more international and accountability requirements increasingly stringent, the chairman of the board must confront a constantly evolving array of risks and responsibilities. Lechem identifies a chairman's four primary functions:* Concentrate on strategic leadership, focusing on an appropriate and realistic vision* Ensure that the board is constituted with a good blend of skills, experience, and business competence* Guarantee that the corporation has the policies, procedures, and resources in place to achieve its goals* Monitor the achievement of these goals and ensure that the board is provided with the appropriate information it needs to be effectiveLechem offers practical advice on matters such as how to work with the CEO, ethical considerations, corporate social responsibility, and performance evaluation of boards and board members. He discusses key regulatory issues and legal exposures the board must address in an increasingly litigious society and addresses the thorny problem of board disagreement and dissent-the moment &#x22;management&#x22; is tossed aside and a chairman's &#x22;leadership&#x22; must take center stage.Chairing a board of directors undoubtedly requires a host of intangible skills, but applying Brian Lechem's proven, practical guidelines will nevertheless give a chairman the best chance for success. Chairman of the Board is a must-read for any professional who aspires to the peak of his or her profession.","price":{"$numberDouble":"9.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jHaCvdkdL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B00G8O9MM4","B008E6KUB6","B00261OP8O","B004QGY3VQ","B008NC0UES","B008N9J50G","B000SEJVMQ","B0062O7LK0","B007T02Q7Y","B008L01JWO","B001DUGOX8","B002SN9GJ8"],"buy_after_viewing":["B0041OTB24"]},"categories":[["Books","Business & Money","Economics"],["Books","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Decision-Making & Problem Solving"],["Books","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Leadership"],["Books","Business & Money","Popular Economics"],["Books","Business & Money","Small Business & Entrepreneurship","Entrepreneurship"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Business & Money","Economics"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Business & Money","Entrepreneurship & Small Business","Entrepreneurship"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Decision-Making & Problem Solving"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Leadership"]],"author":null,"title":"Chairman of the Board: A Practical Guide","genres":["Management & Leadership","Entrepreneurship","Entrepreneurship & Small Business","Leadership","Economics","Business & Money","Popular Economics","Small Business & Entrepreneurship","Decision-Making & Problem Solving"]}

It covers the typology of metric spaces, continuity, connectedness, compactness and product spaces &#x2026; . The material is developed at a leisurely pace and applications of the theory are discussed throughout, making this book ideal as a classroom text for third- and fourth-year undergraduates or as a self-study resource for graduate students and researchers.&#x22; (L&#x2019;Enseignement Mathematique, Vol. 51 (3-4), 2005)&#x22;This book on metric spaces was written by authors whose main field is analysis. Therefore its focus lies on those parts of the theory of metric spaces which are mainly used in (functional) analysis. &#x2026; Altogether this is an interesting book for those who will continue their studies in analysis.&#x22; (H. Brandenburg, Zentralblatt Math, Vol. 1095 (21), 2006)&#x22;This book introduces the fundamentals of analysis in metric spaces. It&#x2019;s written in a very spare theorem-proof-example style; has illustrative examples and exercises; spends little time on discussion, development of intuition, or substantial applications; begins by stating that the abstract postulational method has a vital role in modern mathematics; implicitly assumes this is the way to teach mathematics.

Throughout, Seaward intersperses brief meditation and journaling exercises. Yet the book feels hollow. While Seaward touches on some profound Taoist principles&#x2014;as one might expect, given the book's title&#x2014;he fails to investigate these teachings in any depth. Instead, he uses them as a broad,a prioritemplate for an &#x22;ageless wisdom&#x22; held by generic &#x22;wisdom keepers.&#x22; He then cites examples of this wisdom from a wide range of other sources and traditions, including Native American spirituality, Joseph Campbell's writings, and DNA research. This lack of focus is exacerbated by the text's habit of substituting unsatisfying anecdotes for a probing exploration of a given point. The result is a superficial amalgam of sweeping generalizations, inspirational clich&#xe9;s (&#x22;even the darkest night has bright stars!&#x22;), sentimental stories of triumph over adversity and quotes from the likes of Mother Teresa, Einstein and Lance Armstrong. Some of Seaward's spirituality-based ideas for navigating stress may have dimension and weight, but his treatment leaves them feeling trivial.Copyright &#xa9; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Varchaver and Moore (coauthors of The  Dictionary of the Performing Arts) tried to limit the number of  entries by including only those recently adopted, but as a  result the word choice seems arbitrary. Entries include  pronunciation, definition, and often a sample sentence to  illustrate use. However, only about a quarter of the words have  sample sentences, and many of the less familiar words were not  among them. In addition, many of the samples are quite generic,  and some include a citation noting the source, which seems  unnecessary since this is not an academic book. This work may be  of interest to the &#x22;browser&#x22; of the title and of limited  assistance to someone seeking a simple etymology, but the  serious scholar or lover of the language will find it  lightweight.

Isadora has built a tough exterior so as to not get hurt again. She is an intelligent woman who has cut herself off from people, yet instead of deterring Beau, he is captivated by what is hidden behind her prickly fa&#xe7;ade. This proposition allows Beau to carefully plan a slow seduction of Isadora&#x2019;s body and heart even though she is uncomfortable being ten years his senior. The connection they feel is quite passionate and never humiliating. The use of BDSM allows Beau to slowly teach Isadora to trust him and more importantly herself. The sex scenes, although later in the story, were quite seductive and well worth the wait. The anticipation of their union was orchestrated so well that toys should be at close hand. The main focus of the story is the building relationship between Isadora and Beau with minor secondary characters that help to initiate the proposal. I found that even though Beau likes to be in control, he gives up his control for Isadora by cherishing and making her feel special. Beau is definitely a hero that I fell in love with at the very beginning. Not only did Beau have the perfect lure for Isadora, he saw beyond her beastly reputation to her inner beauty. I found this tale an entertaining entry to the BDSM genre.

I was pleased to find myself in a medieval time period with sorcerers, knights, and damsels in distress. Ms. Hilton created a very special group of characters that allowed you to pick your favorite hero and villain. I enjoyed the nuances that Ms. Hilton gave to the primary and secondary characters in the story. The plot flowed smoothly. While we were left with a cliff hanger towards the end, I found that I wasn&#x2019;t disappointed and the anticipation just makes the story that much sweeter. The love Lucien and Aislan shared was extremely sensual and well written. This is the first story I have read from Ms. Hilton and it will not be my last.&#x22; &#x2014;LT Blue,Just Erotic Romance Reviews&#x22;Vision of Lightwill take readers on a journey where the characters of Lucien and Aislan battle many [magical] creatures to save themselves, and their burgeoning attraction.

Each character&#x2019;s inner struggle in trying to come to terms with who they really are and what they want from life is touching.Vision of Lightis wonderfully written, and lovers of fantasy will most definitely enjoy the read.

The story also has a dark intensity and undertone that I totally enjoy and love.

Will Susanna and Dare be able to defeat the supernatural powers that are thrown against them?&#x22;&#x2014;Candy,Ecataromance4 Stars, 2006 Reviewers' Choice Award Nominee:&#x22;Mortal Melodyis the kind of story that really gets you right from the beginning. Although there are things that are unexplained (i.e. Dare's unusual powers), this fast-paced story still makes you want more. You'll be glued to your screen just waiting to discover what will happen next. Although Susanna is young and doesn't realize it herself, she's strong. She willingly faces her fears in order to complete her father's last wishes. Perhaps because of her dire circumstances and the fact that Dare is so charismatic, she willingly submits to his seduction.

That was perhaps the most important statement in this story for me. Dean was the perfect bad boy who realized he wanted to give all of that sexual heat to one special woman for life. The sexual acts between Dean and Veronica were very hot and steamy.

Veronica is the rich girl who comes home to live a life of adventure. Dean is the bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks who has cleaned himself up and is going after the woman he wants.

McKeever not only paints the picture of a wonderfully creative world but keeps the characters reactions to outrageous circumstances true to life. I couldn't put this one down. The attraction and love that blossoms between Genesis and Alex was hot enough to feed a volcano and was strong enough to stand the tests of time. They came up against many walls during their adventures together that just couldn't stop their combined efforts. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a little political intrigue and otherworldly beings with their erotica.&#x22; &#x2014;Tara,Two Lips Reviews4 Cups:&#x22;Guardian Seductressis a chill-tingling fantastic read. Ms. McKeever pens a fabulous tale. When Alex was confronted with the woman with hazel eyes, I think I was just as frightened as he was. I kept looking for claw like fingers to jump from the pages. Ms. McKeever fashions a gripping story that this reader enjoyed very much and look for the others in the series.&#x22; &#x2014;Cherokee,Coffee Time Romance&#xa0;4 Blue Ribbons:&#x22;Guardian Seductressis a shape-shifting, paranormal, fantasy thrill ride that will keep readers on the edge of their seats.&#xa0;I have read several books by Gracie McKeever and each one has its own appeal. Her writing is creative and readers will love her flair for intrigue.&#x22; &#x2014;Angel,Romance Junkies4 Hearts:&#x22;Ms. McKeever has created a vividly imaginative world. A fantastical tale that will resonate long after the last page is turned. This story is hot, hot, hot and any reader that likes fantasy and doesn&#x2019;t mind explicit language and sex will absolutely love this tale as much as this reviewer did!&#x22;&#x2014;Leah,LoveRomancesandMore.com","categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction","Erotica"],["Books","Romance","Fantasy"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Erotica","Romantic Erotica"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Romance","Fantasy"]],"genres":["Fantasy","Romance","Romantic Erotica","Erotica","Literature & Fiction"]}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963b2a"},"asin":"B000QCTNQ4","description":"&#x22;Hey, Trent, you're on TV .&#x22;Trent Matheson didn't look up from his laptop computer. &#x22;Am I with a blonde?&#x22;He didn't know how the media managed to get so many different shots of him with so many different blondes. At the very least, it seemed like discrimination against brunettes. Trent had dated a brunette a couple of months back, he was certain. Almost certain.The regular sounds of Matheson Racing's race car prep- aration&#x97;the clang of metal on metal, the hiss of the air guns, the whine of the welding torch&#x97;ceased as everyone except Trent looked up at the TV. Then Rod Sutton, Trent's crew chief, said,  &#x22;She's blond, for sure. But not your kind of blond .&#x22;Trent hit the Send button that would transmit his e-mail newsletter to thousands of NASCAR fans all over America, then checked out the TV high on the wall at the far end of the workshop. The sound was off, but sure enough there he was, his face blown up large behind the woman. Like Rod said, she was blond. Pretty, but awkward-looking. The on-screen caption read Kelly Greenwood, Sport Psychology Consultant.&#x22;Not another one,&#x22; he muttered. Another expert with an opinion on what made Trent Matheson a winner. He shook his head&#x97;he'd rather spend his time answering the dozens of fan e-mails that had come in today than listen to what other people said about him. Then a picture of Danny Cruise flashed up on the screen alongside Trent's face. Cruise was his number-one rival for the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series.&#x22;Turn up the sound, will you?&#x22; Trent called to Rod. When the volume came up, the camera had panned back to show the TV network's traveling prerace studio. Kelly Greenwood was one of four guests being interviewed by host Chris Spires. Trent recognized the other three: a regular race analyst, a former Cup champion who wasn't racing this year and a retired crew chief. All male.&#x22;Okay, folks, let's have your picks,&#x22; Chris Spires said.&#x22;Trent Matheson won last week's NASCAR race here in Charlotte&#x97;can he do it again this Sunday?&#x22;The analyst spoke up first.  &#x22;Cruise is good, but I'm picking Trent Matheson .&#x22;&#x22;Matheson, without a doubt,&#x22; the retired driver agreed.A cheer went up around the Matheson Racing workshop. Trent flashed a grin to his team.  &#x22;Smart guys, huh?&#x22;The ex-crew chief took a little longer to make up his mind. He sounded reluctant when he said,  &#x22;It'll go down to the wire, but Matheson will win it .&#x22;A grumble ran around the workshop, but Trent waved it away with good humor. He knew the ex-chief's reluctance stemmed from the fact that Trent had dated his daughter, then ended it when she refused to accept what he'd told her all along, that he wasn't after a serious relationship. The old guy just plain didn't like him. But he couldn't deny Trent was the standout driver in this year's field.&#x22;What about you, Kelly?&#x22; Chris Spires turned a smile on the blonde.For a bare second, she froze. Then her tongue came out to moisten her lips, and she cleared her throat. She lifted a hand to push a stray strand of hair behind her ear, but her watch tangled in the cord of the microphone clipped to her shirt. There was a brief, inelegant tussle that had the guys in the to the TV and hit the off button before she could sentence. He turned to the assembled company.  &#x22;What say we invite her to join me in Victory Lane after I win tomorrow?&#x22;There was a chorus of support from every corner except the one that mattered. Chad Matheson, who sometimes forgot he'd been Trent's older brother for thirty-one years and his boss for just five, was rubbing his chin as if he actually lent some credence to the garbage that woman had spouted. Chad said,  &#x22;She's right, you did crash out twice in a row .&#x22;&#x22;Eight million Americans could have told you that,&#x22; Trent snapped.Thanks for the vote of confidence, bro.&#x22;You did that last season,&#x22; Chad said.  &#x22;You won two, lost two, won two, lost two .&#x22;Deliberately, Trent stayed where he was, next to the life- size poster of himself pinned to the wall below the TV set. They'd sold thousands of those posters when Trent won the NASCAR Busch Series. he'd autographed so many, he'd practically gotten carpal tunnel syndrome.  &#x22;I finished top- three the next five after that, and I won the Busch series. For the second time,&#x22; he reminded his brother. He knew what Chad would say to that.&#x22;The Cup is different .&#x22;Bingo.Chad continued,  &#x22;There's more pressure, you don't have the same experience in the series .&#x22;So what if Trent had been the highest-performing rookie in the history of the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series on his debut two years ago? So what if last year he'd set the fastest lap time more often than any other driver and had finished fifth in the series, leaving everyone to predict another quantum leap in his performance this season? Chad wouldn't be confident of victory until he was standing next to Trent in Victory Lane, helping hold up that coveted sterling silver trophy.&#x22;I'm ready for this,&#x22; Trent told his brother. The two men locked glares for several long seconds. Chad looked away first, and it was as if a spell had been broken, freeing the crew to return to their work of setting up the Number 186 car for Sunday's race.Trent let a confident swagger into his walk as he did the rounds of the workshop, checking on the cars, cracking jokes and giving the guys the encouragement that helped bond them into an unbeatable team.He planned to win on Sunday. No sport psychologist was going to tell him otherwise.KELLY GREENWOOD popped the top of her soda and set the can down on the coffee table. She sank into the comfort of her leather couch. What more could a girl want than a Sunday spent watching the most exciting motor racing in the world? Even better, it counted as work.She switched on the TV just as the NASCAR theme music played. Along with the 170,000-odd people at the track, she closed her eyes for the invocation, then sang along to the national anthem.And when the grand marshal said those time- honored words,  &#x22;Gentlemen, start your engines,&#x22; she felt the familiar lurch in the pit of her stomach. Who needed to go to the race, when watching it at home was as good as being there?Who am I kidding?She'd have loved to be at the race track, rather than sitting here in the condo she'd rented for the duration of the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series. But insulting Char- lotte's favorite homegrown race driver had made her Public Enemy Number One. Who knew Trent Matheson had so many fans?And who knew one little TV interview would make Kelly instantly recognizable to the complete strangers who'd up- braided her this morning at the mall, at the park, even in church?Turning up at today's race might start a riot. She should never have been so rash as to predict Trent Matheson wouldn't go more than half of today's four hundred laps.I'm a psychologist, not a psychic.Kelly huffed out an anxious breath that lifted the bangs off her forehead. Maybe she'd gone too far. But Suze, her friend who was a production assistant on the network's NASCAR show, had warned her to make the most of this opportunity to stand in for Don Carson, motor racing's foremost sport psy- chologist, after he had a minor car accident.&#x22;Don't say 'uh.&#x22; Don't fiddle with your hair. Smile. Talk in sound bites.&#x22; Suze had fired instructions at Kelly as an as- sistant applied makeup that felt heavier than normal, but would apparently come out okay on TV.  &#x22;Whatever you do, don't go along with everyone else&#x97;say something different .&#x22;Which sounded fine, until Kelly heard who the other guests were.&#x22;Those guys have a combined experience of about a thousand years in NASCAR,&#x22; she said, horrified. How could she, a longtime fan but with zero professional involvement, contradict them?When they all picked Trent Matheson to win, that's exactly what she had to do. If a snappy sound bite would help estab- lish her as a sport psychology consultant in NASCAR&#x97;well, she wasn't about to blow it. She'd been knocking on the doors of the top racing teams for months, getting only dumb jokes about shrinks and offers of driver autographs for her trouble. No use at all to a woman who had to resurrect her career before her family discovered just how badly she'd failed.She'd done what she had to.Trent Matheson is a casualty of my ambition.Kelly chewed on the thought then spat it out. Matheson was the poster boy of this year's NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series. Never without a pretty blond girl, always with a charming smile on his lips&#x97; maybe he'd spent a fortune on dentistry and didn't want to waste the results&#x97;Matheson had the ego of a champion.And the brain of a&#x97;well, put it this way: Trent Matheson wasn't the sharpest tool in the box.She could tell from the way he gave long consideration to the most inane of the journalists' questions, always delivering his eventual answer in a drawl punctuated by  &#x22;uh's&#x22; and  &#x22;huh's .&#x22;Kelly's comment would have slid off him like a race car off a wet track.She watched as the cars circled the track in their starting order. In any case, she was probably about to be proved com- pletely wrong. Matheson was starting this race in pole position, thanks to an outstanding performance in Friday's qualifying, and he had a record of being hard to catch off the pole.Kelly winced as they showed once more that clip of her saying  &#x22;not a chance&#x22; and predicting Trent wouldn't last two hundred laps. Couldn't they just start the darned race?Suze had assured her after the interview that it didn't matter if she was wrong. Viewers had been phoning and e-mailing the station, some to agree with her, more to disagree.  &#x22;We love that,&#x22; Suze said.  &#x22;I'm certain you'll be invited back .&#x22;&#x22;Which means,&#x22; Kelly told herself aloud now,  &#x22;it's fine by me if Trent Matheson runs all four hundred laps without a problem.&#x22;But if something goes wrong&#x97;nothing that might hurt him...","price":{"$numberDouble":"4.16"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51eTE0c5lnL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B002WEPD2C","B0023EF9RA","B0017SWPQ6","B0013TTK0S","B0041KLDP6","B00134D78E","B0037NB49I","B002B9MH7M","B000QCTO3G","B0014BRMU0","B0023EFA2E","B000UH5Z0I","B0037NB736","B002B9MHG8","B002PKBL1U","B0013N882U","B001OERNI8","B0015DWLEO","B000QCTNWI","B002SVQDPK","B002WEPDT0","B002WEPDF4","B005IGW8CO","B0013TTLMK","B002WEPE7G","B000NJL84K","B004XDYXKI","B004AYD5LI","B0037NB65A","B008X47JO0","B002HJ1XOY","B001R4GN72","B002HJ1WVI","B001FA0Q5S","B006YAD2UU","B000NJL7ZU","B001FA0RLQ","B001FA0PIG","B0011UCOFC","B0017SWT58","B002WEPEL2","B009NEDOTI","B004HW6EJ8","B000UH5Z5S","B003U89SK2","B0015Z7W0A","B0041KLEVE","B001R4GNJA","B000UZPHGW","B002PKBLUG","B000XPNW66","B009NEISUI","B0037NB7J0","B001FA0R66","B002HJ1W86","B009NEITKC","B004AYD59A","B009NEIAI8","B001ANUOAM","B009037VQE","B009NEISL2","B003U89SKM","B000QCTO6S","B009NEIR1S","B0088NH0WM","B000UZPHEO","B000W915Q2","B000W93BVE","B0059HJZYG","B001E28LYA","B00B0A70DY","B005ISQ7LA","B001E28LU4","B005WKH5AQ","B0015DWKDG","B001E28LRC","B009NEML2E","B000XPNVGM","B009NEFT1Y","B004RZ30H4","B0013TPVMO","B001DUGOIS","B0085325GQ","B009NEIB00","B00JYKUJ6M","B009NEETKG","B009NEIR8G","B004JF6D4O","B00I15VK6O","B005LXWKO0","B00ATMP8K6","B007SWTY82","B0062WC4EU","B00991SQNY","B00ILC52GQ","B00L7NTYBU","B00L7NTY42","B00L7NTY2Y","B00G79ZNK0","B005WKH56K"],"buy_after_viewing":["B0037NB49I","B0017SWPQ6","B009NEDOTI","B0041KLDP6"]},"categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction","United States"],["Books","Romance","Contemporary"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Contemporary Fiction","Romance"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Romance","Contemporary"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Romance","Series","Harlequin NASCAR"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Romance","Sports"]],"genres":["Series","Harlequin NASCAR","Contemporary Fiction","Romance","Contemporary","Sports","United States","Literature & Fiction"]}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963b2b"},"asin":"B000QCTO3G","description":"Jamie shook off a wave of regret as she pulled into the parking lot at McGuireville Community Hospital. She found a space and parked the rental Mustang&#x97;red, of course.Please have him be okay.Resting her forehead on the steering wheel, she allowed herself a moment of weakness. What would she do if he died? The world without Jimmy Tanner was too scary to contemplate, even though he'd let her down all those years ago. Somehow, she'd always felt the world would continue to rotate on its axis as long as her daddy was in the engine-building shop. Maybe because that meant there was still a chance for things to turn out right.Jamie straightened, reaching for her Detroit Pistons ball cap as she flipped down the vanity mirror on the visor. She smoothed her hair into a ponytail and twisted an elastic band to hold it, then pulled the tail through the back of her cap. She settled the brim low on her forehead. There. No one would remember her as a Poultry Princess now. And her mom wouldn't think she'd succeeded in molding her only daughter into a proper Southern lady.She pressed the lock tab for the Mustang and hurried to the double doors. Raising her chin, she prepared for what was to come. A burly guy did a double take as she walked by then let out a low whistle.Jamie ignored him. Glancing down, she realized her scoop neck T-shirt fit more snugly than she realized. Her clothes were normally chosen with care, sure to deflect rather than draw attention.Jamie shrugged. Nothing to be done about it now. When she reached the information desk, the volunteer seemed familiar.&#x22;Why, Jamie Lynn Tanner, I haven't seen you in ages. Not since the Poultry Princess pageant .&#x22;Jamie managed a smile.  &#x22;I'm here to see my father. Is my mother already with him?&#x22;&#x22;Yes, dear. The waiting room is on the second floor, to the right. Tom's upstairs, too .&#x22;&#x22;Of course. Thank you, Mrs. White.&#x22; Luckily, she'd remembered the woman's name.&#x22;Certainly, dear. Your mother will be so pleased you're home. I'm sure she'll have you back wearing a dress in no time,&#x22; she said, smiling.Jamie suppressed a groan. That's what she was afraid of.Choosing the stairs, she took them two at a time to make herself feel strong and in control. Because if there was one thing she felt around her family, it was out of control.TOM TANNER GLANCED up from his cup of machine- dispensed coffee and stiffened. His sister, ubermechanic extraordinaire and their father's favorite, strode across rubbed him the wrong way. He responded in kind.  &#x22;Hi, Metal Mouth .&#x22;Amusement lurked in her green eyes, so much like their mother's.  &#x22;Thanks, Boy Wonder.&#x22; It was a back- handed reference to his childhood obsession with superheroes.Tom slouched in his seat. Why did he feel like a gawky kid again? The answer stood before him in all her blonde perfection. Even in casual clothes and a ball cap, Jamie was clearly blessed with the good looks in the family. No wonder there hadn't been many left over for him.&#x22;No problem, Your Highness,&#x22; he said.His sister flushed. Score one for the kid brother.&#x22;Stop it you two,&#x22; their mother scolded.Shrugging off his irritation, he allowed himself to be the bigger person, as his mother had put it. His voice was husky when he said,  &#x22;It's good to see you, Sis .&#x22;And, surprisingly enough, itwasgood to have her back. He just didn't want her staying too long.Jamie smiled, showing off her excellent orthodontia. She leaned down and hugged him quickly.  &#x22;Hey, Tom. It's good to see you, too .&#x22;He swallowed hard. Losing his sister had been wrenching. But having her back could destroy every- thing he'd worked for.She straightened, addressing their mother.  &#x22;How's Daddy doing?&#x22;&#x22;They already have him up and around if you can believe it. I thought it was too soon after a quadruple bypass, but they start rehabilitation right away .&#x22;&#x22;Probably for the best. You know Dad&#x97;he doesn't like to sit around much,&#x22; Tom commented.His mother straightened.  &#x22;He's going to be taking it a lot easier. Isn't he, Tom?&#x22;Tom would have preferred to face a pack of angry stock car drivers than face his mom when she'd made a decision. He knew when to admit defeat. If only tem- porarily.  &#x22;Yes, Ma'am .&#x22;&#x22;Jamie, the doctor should be done examining your father if you'd like to see him. We'll wait here. Your brother has a business proposition to discuss with you after that .&#x22;&#x22;Mom .&#x22;Even he detected a whine in his voice. Here he was, a grown man and partner in a world-renowned performance engine business, and he was reduced to sniveling. He shot his sister a look.  &#x22;Thomas Edward Tanner .&#x22;That was all it took. Tom sighed.  &#x22;Yes, Ma'am. Jamie, I'll talk to you over lunch .&#x22;Jamie nodded, frowning.Tom watched her ponytail swing in time with her confident stride. He had the feeling Cyclone Jamie was about to unleash her damage and it would be his career that took the hit.JAMIE TIPTOED into her father's room. His eyes were closed and he was hooked up to all sorts of machines. She sat in the chair next to the bed, taking the opportu- nity to watch him, really noticing how much he'd aged in recent years.His hair was mostly gray and his face rounder, yet more lined. Her heart ached at the changes in him. And for the fact that she'd been away so much during the last twelve years.As if sensing her gaze, her father opened his eyes. &#x22;Jamie,&#x22; he murmured.She grasped his hand.  &#x22;I'm here, Daddy .&#x22;&#x22;Yes, you are.&#x22; He tried to smile, but it was a pale version of his usual cocky grin.&#x22;You scared me .&#x22;&#x22;I scared myself. I'm glad you came. Your mother needs someone to lean on&#x97;I worry about her .&#x22;&#x22;Daddy, she's one of the strongest people I know. But I'll do what I can.You just concentrate on getting well .&#x22;&#x22;The old ticker's good as new. Maybe even better .&#x22;&#x22;You just had a quadruple bypass. That's serious stuff. I'm sure your doctor is going to expect you to make some lifestyle changes .&#x22;He grimaced.  &#x22;Yeah, a social worker's going to talk to us about that. And a nutritionist. Your mother's already talking about getting a bunch of heart-healthy cookbooks .&#x22;&#x22;Good for her. She'll keep you on the straight and narrow .&#x22;&#x22;You know it.&#x22; He rubbed her hand with his thumb.&#x22;It's good to see you, Kitten .&#x22;Her throat constricted at his use of his old pet name. &#x22;Yeah. Good to see you, too .&#x22;I've missed you, Daddy.But she couldn't bring herself to say the words. Instead, she opted for a quick retreat to regroup.  &#x22;I'm gonna let you rest. I'll be back later this afternoon .&#x22;He nodded. His lack of protest bothered her. He was weaker than he would admit.JAMIE PUSHED the lettuce around with her fork. She eyed Tom. His appetite seemed unimpaired.&#x22;How's your chicken fried steak?&#x22; she asked.&#x22;Excellent, as usual. The diner has the best food this side of Mom's table .&#x22;&#x22;Their salads could use some imagination .&#x22;&#x22;We have simple tastes here in Arkansas. You've gotten spoiled in the big city.&#x22; His smirk told her he thought she'd always been treated specially.She decided not to rise to her brother's bait.  &#x22;Hmm. We best not debate who's more spoiled or we could be here for days. Dad's concerned about Mom having our support. It won't help if we're at each other's throats all the time .&#x22;Tom sighed.  &#x22;Yeah. Mom's worried about Dad and Dad's worried about Mom. And we're stuck in the middle .&#x22;&#x22;We're their kids. That's where we're supposed to be. Besides, I think it's kind of cute .&#x22;Tom snorted. &#x22;I take it you don't have anyone special to worry over you like that? Things didn't work out with Tiffany or Brittany or whatever her name was?&#x22; she asked.&#x22;Nope. I'm married to my job. How about you?&#x22;&#x22;The same.&#x22; Except that her job would be nonexis- tent in a couple of months. Who knew sales of domestic minivans could take such a hit?&#x22;I thought things were going to work out with you and that engineer .&#x22;&#x22;I thought so, too.&#x22; Her words were quiet, her hurt probably evident. It still stung to think she'd actually believed they'd had a shot at the white picket fence and two-point-five kids.Jamie shrugged to defuse her vulnerability.  &#x22;He couldn't figure out why I need to spend so much time helping out at the racetrack when I design engines all day. It's an outlet that keeps me sane, allows me to be hands-on in a way I can't be at work .&#x22;&#x22;And his outlet?&#x22;&#x22;Getting hands-on with a sweet young thing from the accounting department .&#x22;&#x22;Ouch.&#x22; Tom winced.&#x22;It was almost a year ago. I'm over it .&#x22;&#x22;Sure. He didn't deserve you anyway .&#x22;Jamie hoped she didn't detect a trace of pity in his voice. She sipped her sweet tea, stalling for time. Finally, she phrased a question that nagged at her.  &#x22;How is it that our parents, who have such a strong marriage, could produce two children who can't seem to get re- lationships right?&#x22;&#x22;Hey, I didn't say I couldn't get it right. I just don't want to at the moment. My career's too important .&#x22;&#x22;Yeah, you're a horrible liar,Tommy. Always were .&#x22; She was gratified to see the tips of his ears redden. They were back on solid, familiar ground.&#x22;And you're a sanctimonious bi&#x97;&#x22;She raised her hand, palm outward.  &#x22;Ah-ah. You wouldn't want me to tell mom you're being uncoopera- tive, would you?&#x22;He slouched in the booth, his glum expression so reminiscent of when he'd been a kid it almost tugged at her heart. Almost.&#x22;D'you ever notice we both turn into ten-year-olds when we're together?&#x22; she asked.&#x22;You mean you're not that way all the time?&#x22; His eyes sparkled with amusement.&#x22;Let's make a real effort to act like adults. What's the business proposition Mom mentioned?&#x22;&#x22;Promise you'll hear me out?&#x22;&#x22;Sounds like you already know I'm not g...","price":{"$numberDouble":"4.16"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AdFRXKPdL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B0017SWPQ6","B00134D78E","B0023EFA2E","B0037NB49I","B002WEPD2C","B000UH5Z0I","B0015DWLEO","B000QCTNQ4","B0041KLDP6","B002B9MH7M","B0023EF9RA","B000NJL84K","B001R4GN72","B004HW6EJ8","B000QCTNWI","B0059HJZYG","B002WEPDT0","B002PKBL1U","B0013TTK0S","B002WEPDF4","B000NJL7ZU","B0013TTLMK","B004AYD5LI","B000UH5Z5S","B0037NB736","B002B9MHG8","B002HJ1WVI","B002WEPEL2","B001FA0Q5S","B009NEDOTI","B0017SWT58","B001DUGOIS","B001E28LYA","B0041KLEVE","B001FA0PIG","B000UZPHGW","B000XPNW66","B0037NB7J0","B001FA0RLQ","B004AYD59A","B000QCTO6S","B0015Z7W0A","B0011UCOFC","B0037NB65A","B009NEIR1S","B000W915Q2","B009NEITKC","B001R4GNJA","B002PKBLUG","B004RZ30H4","B002HJ1W86","B001FA0R66","B000UZPHEO","B003U89SK2","B001ANUOAM","B003U89SKM","B009NEML2E","B009NEIAI8","B009NEISUI","B0015DWKDG","B000W93BVE","B009NEISL2","B0013TPVMO","B001E28LU4","B005ISQ7LA","B009NEFT1Y","B009037VQE","B009NEETKG","B000XPNVGM","B0014BRMU0","B0085325GQ","B005LXWKO0","B0062WC4EU","B001E28LRC","B009NEIR8G","B004XDYXKI","B00991SQNY","B007SWTY82","B009NEIB00","B0013N882U","B002SVQDPK","B00JYKUJ6M","B008DYPAZ0","B00HFU5RIS","B005IGW8CO","B001OERNI8","B002WEPEIA","B00J6U1DOW","B0087PJ8YY","B00I57MSE6","B00K39ANE6","B00KOEY3HI","B00ASBYU6Q","B00JD223XS","B00452VF08","B008X47JO0","B00I53BL84","B009TTO0MC"],"buy_after_viewing":["B002PKBL1U","B0023EFA2E","B0017SWPQ6","B00134D78E"]},"categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction","United States"],["Books","Romance","Contemporary"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Contemporary Fiction","Romance"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Romance","Contemporary"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Romance","Series","Harlequin NASCAR"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Romance","Sports"]],"genres":["Series","Harlequin NASCAR","Contemporary Fiction","Romance","Contemporary","Sports","United States","Literature & Fiction"]}

L. Doctorow wrote in The New York Times Book Review. Generally considered to be London's greatest achievement, The Call of the Wild brought him international acclaim when it was published in 1903. His story of the dog Buck, who learns to survive in the bleak Yukon wilderness, is viewed by many as his symbolic autobiography. &#x22;No other popular writer of his time did any better writing than you will find in The Call of the Wild,&#x22; said H.

Stanley Wertheim's longtime interest in, collecting of, and publishing about Stephen Crane come to wonderful fruition in this Encyclopedia....A Stephen Crane Encyclopedia appeals to anyone involved with Anglo-American literary currents and eddies during &#x22;transition&#x22; years. Crane was important in that transition, and as such he should not go unrecognized except as the author of either The Red Badge of Courage or Maggie - only those and nothing more. Wertheim makes us aware that there is plenty more.?-English Literature in Transition","categories":[["Books","Literature & Fiction","History & Criticism","Movements & Periods"],["Books","Literature & Fiction","United States","Classics"],["Books","Reference","Encyclopedias & Subject Guides","Literature"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","History & Criticism","Criticism & Theory"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Reference","Encyclopedias"]],"genres":["Criticism & Theory","Classics","History & Criticism","Reference","Encyclopedias & Subject Guides","Encyclopedias","United States","Literature & Fiction","Literature","Movements & Periods"]}

But her younger stepbrother, Jeremy, has lost their plantation in a card game, and has put her in the uncomfortable position of having to ask Tony, who holds the IOU, for mercy. He agrees to return it on the condition that Arabella discreetly become his mistress. She reluctantly agrees, and soon realizes that she never stopped loving him, but a mysterious man known only as &#x22;Boots&#x22; schemes against them. He wants to destroy Tony's reputation, and keep him and Arabella apart. The two soon realize a plan is afoot, and, with the help of a maturing Jeremy, try to solve the mystery. Set against a backdrop of political intrigue in the fledgling U.S., Busbee's plot offers few surprises, but her interesting and dynamic characters are sure to please historical romance fans.Patty EngelmannCopyright &#xa9; American Library Association.

Readers new to securities will find it an excellent primer, one that relies on time-honored indicators such as quarterly earnings, market capitalization, and daily indexes. O'Neil's study of winning stocks stretches back to the 1960s, and he shares his insights here, describing what characterizes a growth stock, when to cut your losses (at 7 or 8 percent, no more), and how to spot a market top.The techniques inHow to Make Money in Stocksare hardly revolutionary, but therein lies their strength, as O'Neil claims his is &#x22;a winning system in good times or bad.&#x22; Investors interested in Net stocks might be disappointed--the author's first rule is that a company must show a pattern of growing profits, which disqualifies many dot coms. (TryRule Breakers, Rule Makersfor a different take.) O'Neil's approach to stocks is, above all, rational, and he pays little heed to market hype.Those new to investing would do well to read this book before embarking, and even more seasoned traders may findHow to Make Money in Stocksa refreshing return to basics.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963b37"},"asin":"B000QCUETO","description":"Brian S. Langton first contemplated writing a book while lying, virtually paralysed, in a rehabilitation ward. He had earlier been stricken with a particularly serious form of Guillain-Barr&#233; Syndrome, sometimes referred to as G.B.S., and had already spent over seven months in intensive care, more than six of those months on a ventilator for breathing assistance. He had recovered his ability to speak, and was becoming used to entertaining visitors by recounting some of the dream sequences he had experienced during his period of hospitalisation. He was interested and encouraged by the positive messages he appeared to be providing to his visitors.Many of the dreams were quite hilarious, in spite of Brian's serious predicament, and it occurred to him that a collection of them would make for interesting reading. It had also become evident that few had experience of G.B.S., and he was constantly being made aware of just how rare the illness was, and of the nursing community's appetite for knowledge about the Syndrome. It was this realisation which prompted Brian to seriously consider writing a book, not just about the dream sequences but to produce a sort of handbook on G.B.S., suitable for medical professionals, caregivers, G.B.S. patients and relatives, alike.Upon eventual discharge from hospital, Brian carried these thoughts home. He could not write at that time. It was only just possible for him to move his right arm in a limited way from the shoulder. His recreational therapist had arranged a one finger splint to allow him to use a computer keyboard by pressing one key at a time, but it would take more than that to write a book, or so he thought. It was not until a student caregiver convinced him that he was physically capable of writing the book he was contemplating, even if it meant using 'voice software' and possibly, if the worst came to the worst, by the one finger typing method.Thus encouraged, and in spite of no writing experience, Brian, with the help and encouragement of that student, commenced work on his book at the start of the new millennium, January 2000.Brian was born in Derbyshire, England in 1928. He was educated at the West Bridgford Grammar School, Nottingham. After two years of service in the British Army, he embarked on an accounting career, which eventually led to a senior financial position in Salisbury, Wiltshire. In 1977, having achieved his career ambition, he emigrated for the second time, to the 'Blue Sky country' - Alberta, Canada - with his wife and three daughters, seeking new challenges.It was in June 1998 when he met with the catastrophic life-threatening illness, Guillain-Barr&#233; Syndrome. At the time of his frightening encounter with that disease, Brian was a healthy 'young' sixty-nine year old International Sales Manager. He was an enthusiastic golfer, even if, in his own words, not particularly good. In addition, he enjoyed various other hobbies, each one calling in its own way for physical fitness. These included gardening, model railroading, and walking. He had, and still has, a keen interest in nature. He loved to spend much of his leisure time walking and enjoying the wildlife that was so abundant in the area close to his home in Calgary.His book, A First Step - Understanding Guillain-Barr&#233; Syndrome, is a personal account of a battle for survival against an acute, chronic form of that rare disease, and his subsequent determination to return to as normal a life as possible. His story should be an inspiration to others.","price":{"$numberDouble":"9.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KkBg7enuL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_viewed":["B004INGZIQ","B00A1L7GZA","B007JF9HGM","B00CWU05BK","B005I48BA4","B00ENTZLJO"],"buy_after_viewing":["B004INGZIQ"]},"categories":[["Books","Biographies & Memoirs","Professionals & Academics","Medical"],["Books","Health, Fitness & Dieting","Diseases & Physical Ailments","AIDS"],["Books","Medical Books","Medicine","Internal Medicine","Pathology","Diseases"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Biographies & Memoirs","Professionals & Academics","Medical"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Health, Fitness & Dieting","Disorders & Diseases","AIDS"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Medical eBooks","Diseases"]],"genres":["Professionals & Academics","AIDS","Pathology","Medical eBooks","Professional & Technical","Medicine","Biographies & Memoirs","Diseases & Physical Ailments","Medical Books","Medical","Internal Medicine","Health, Fitness & Dieting","Diseases","Disorders & Diseases"]}

The authors&#x2019; guiding principle is unique factorization and its consequences. &#x2026; This is not a traditional number theory text, but one that tries to guide the reader through the beginnings of the subject towards the modern frontiers. This is helped along by a good sized bibliography plus many problems &#x2026; . it might provide an interesting experience when used at the graduate level.&#x22; (Don Redmond, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2006 j)&#x22;The book under review contains several topics which are usually not brought together in an introductory text. The book is meant to give a broad introduction to advanced undergraduate students &#x2026; of number theory. &#x2026; Each chapter contains many exercises and historical notes. &#x2026; In my opinion, because so many topics are treated in an accessible way, the book is very well suited for an introductory course in number theory.&#x22; (Jan-Hendrik Evertse, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1089 (15), 2006)&#x22;In An Introduction to Number Theory, the authors strive to have the best of all worlds: they cover a broad range of topics &#x2026; . This book could be used for a number of different courses. &#x2026; The full book would be appropriate for a first-year graduate course. It&#x2019;s also a nice introduction to the subject for established mathematicians form other fields. &#x2026; its extensive bibliography, tasteful collection of topics, and clear presentation make it a pleasant reference even for working number theorists.&#x22; (Rob Benedetto, MathDL, January 2006)","categories":[["Books","Science & Math","Mathematics","Applied","Probability & Statistics"],["Books","Science & Math","Mathematics","Popular & Elementary","Arithmetic"],["Books","Science & Math","Mathematics","Pure Mathematics","Number Theory"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Professional Science","Mathematics","Applied","Statistics"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Professional Science","Mathematics","Pure Mathematics","Number Theory"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Science & Math","Mathematics","Applied","Probability & Statistics"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Science & Math","Mathematics","Popular & Elementary","Arithmetic"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Science & Math","Mathematics","Pure Mathematics","Number Theory"]],"genres":["Number Theory","Mathematics","Science & Math","Professional Science","Probability & Statistics","Professional & Technical","Statistics","Arithmetic","Applied","Pure Mathematics","Popular & Elementary"]}

Rather than offering another partisan polemic, Brophy takes seriously the arguments of both advocates and opponents of reparations, illuminating the complex historical, political, legal, and moral questions entailed by any confrontation with historical injustice. Whatever your politics, you will profit from reading this book.&#x22;--James T. Campbell, author ofMiddle PassagesandSongs of Zion&#x22;Professor Alfred Brophy has written a book about reparations and its contentious qualities that is a must-read for all. While reparations was a dormant subject in the twentieth century, Alfred Brophy has raised it to an exalted status: if you want to know the essence of the debate, this book is for you.&#x22;-Charles K.

Librarian and sf zine editor Klima has corraled 21 authors, speculative-fiction luminaries ranging from Liz Williams and Michael Moorcock to Elizabeth Hand and Jay Lake. In the opening tale, &#x22;The Chiaroscurist,&#x22; a painter specializing in the interplay of light and shadow shoulders an unexpected burden when he hires a gnome to model God's likeness for a planned fresco. &#x22;Logorrhea&#x22; explores the unusual relationship between a woman afflicted with compulsive verbosity and a man whose lizardlike exterior brings out her listening talents. Other entries revolve around the skin conditions eczema and psoriasis, recount the fate of a foreign-exchange expert, or cambist, and more.

Only partially about circles, the text aims &#x22;to examine [for the general reader] the broader relationship between mathematical reasoning and the physical universe.&#x22; Most of the physical examples are common ones, from historical models of the solar system to relativity theory, which standard physics and astronomy texts explain better and just as engagingly. An exception is an intriguing discussion of some techniques used in the construction of the pyramids. The level of exposition varies greatly: a whole chapter is devoted to the elementary relationships of linear dimension, area, and volume, whereas the discussion of wave phenomena uses partial differential equations. There are occasional errors, such as the statement that a neutron star comprises &#x22;billions of protons and neutrons,&#x22; and curious terminology: the list of regular polyhedra repeatedly includes the hexahedron rather than the cube. The endnotes provide appropriate suggestions for further reading, some popular, some scholarly.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963b5a"},"asin":"B000QJLQZS","description":"Starred Review.Princeton scholar Fagles follows up his celebratedIliadandOdysseywith a new, fast-moving, readable rendition of the national epic of ancient Rome. Virgil's long-renowned narrative follows the Trojan warrior Aeneas as he carries his family from his besieged, fallen home, stops in Carthage for a doomed love affair, visits the underworld and founds in Italy, through difficult combat, the settlements that will become, first the Roman republic, and then the empire Virgil knew. Recent translators (such as Allen Mandelbaum) put Virgil's meters into English blank verse. Fagles chooses to forgo meter entirely, which lets him stay literal when he wishes, and grow eloquent when he wants: &#x22;Aeneas flies ahead, spurring his dark ranks on and storming/ over the open fields like a cloudburst wiping out the sun.&#x22; A substantial preface from the eminent classicist Bernard Knox discusses Virgil's place in history, while Fagles himself appends a postscript and notes. Scholars still debate whether Virgil supported or critiqued the empire's expansion; Aeneas' story might prompt new reflection now, when Americans are already thinking about international conflict and the unexpected costs of war.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Collier and MacLachlan discuss their subject's upbringing, education, and marriage as backdrops to his work. Babbage's interest in how things work is traced to his childhood fascination with his toys; his somewhat distant father is seen as a precursor to his relationships with his own children. An interesting sidelight concerns his discontentment with existing British scientific societies and his role as founder of the Astronomical Society of London. The book describes Babbage's interest in mathematics and how his longing for a way to automatically calculate long tables of numbers spurred him to begin designing calculating machines. The text outlines information on the design of his original Difference Engine as well as his plans for the later Analytical Engine, which contained the beginnings of the concepts of computer programming. Informative photos and diagrams illustrate the principles of Babbage's designs. Libraries that do not own Dan Halacy's Charles Babbage (Crowell-Collier, 1970; o.p.) will find this book nearly essential; others should evaluate this new title as more of an update than a replacement for the older book.?Jeffrey A.

Against the advice of her gay best friend Geoffrey, she drags her protesting teenager, Cosette, to Glenhaven Park, N.Y., where shockingly high real estate prices leave her with only one option: a haunted house. Fortunately, the real estate comes with not just a ghost but also a hunky next-door neighbor from Meg's past: widower Sam Rooney, for whom she suffered an unrequited high school crush. Thrown together by their kids (he's a high school teacher as well as a soccer coach), their mutual attraction and things that go bump in the night, the pair are soon waging a futile battle against their romantic instincts. Rita Award&#x2013;winning author Markham (If Only in My Dreams), a pseudonym for Wendi Corsi Staub (Don't Scream), provides a fast-moving, ultralight take on single parenthood, suburban sex and keeping up with the soccer moms that should please chick lit fans; anyone seeking depth should look elsewhere.(July)Copyright &#xa9; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Woodham (history of design, Univ. of Brighton) freely admits that some influences, such as multiculturalism, perestroika, and the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, have been omitted in hopes that this will enhance future studies in these areas. The work reads like a global who's who of designers, architects, cultural and national design organizations, and corporate icons. Each of the ten chapters focuses on a component of design, such as modernism, consumerism, reconstruction after World War II, nostalgia and heritage, and social responsibility. The illustrations fit the text and reflect classic design examples. Woodham successfully highlights design as a powerful marketing tool that has captured the international consumer through culture, socioeconomics, politics, and technology.

This is a broad treatment at a level appropriate for undergraduate science students and sophisticated nonscience majors.  The roles of randomness and order in subjects such as quantum  mechanics, galactic origin and evolution, molecular biology, the evolution of species, and the development of language are presented and discussed in a way that ties them together....Since the chapters are somewhat self-contained, the book could be used effectively as outside reading in a 'science  for nonscientist' class.&#x22;--Choice&#x22;Inspired by cosmology, Layzer deals with the paradox of creation of order by saying that, if entropy in the environment increases more than the entropy of the system, then the system becomes more ordered in that environment. Entropy and order can both increase at the same time without  violating the second law of thermodynamics. This phenomenon can be described as: if the expansion of a set of systems is so quick that a number of states which are occupied increases less rapidly than the number of states which are available (i.e., the phase space gets bigger), entropy and order can  increase at the same time. Unlike Prigogine, Layzer does not need to assume that an energy flow from the environment of a system can cause a local decrease in entropy within the system. Entropy and order increase together because the realization of structure lags behind the expansion of phase  space.&#x22; -- Piero Scaruffi, Thymos.com","categories":[["Books","Politics & Social Sciences","Philosophy","Epistemology"],["Books","Science & Math","Astronomy & Space Science","Astronomy"],["Books","Science & Math","Astronomy & Space Science","Cosmology"],["Books","Science & Math","Evolution"],["Books","Science & Math","Physics"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Professional Science","Physics"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Science & Math","Astronomy & Space Science","Astronomy"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Science & Math","Astronomy & Space Science","Cosmology"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Science & Math","Physics","Cosmology"]],"genres":["Politics & Social Sciences","Physics","Science & Math","Cosmology","Professional Science","Professional & Technical","Astronomy","Astronomy & Space Science","Evolution","Epistemology","Philosophy"]}

Eastern religion bookshelves these days are crowded with Zen primers and collections of sermons by eminent monks or nuns, but Sheng-yen's work stands out, bridging the two genres in a way that has been much needed. Buddhist sermons by Asian masters, when transplanted to American soil, can be misinterpreted by an audience lacking the cultural context for deeper understanding, leading to disillusionment with the institutional practice of Chan/Zen Buddhism. Sheng-yen, having taught in America for many years, is well aware of this and places Chan meditation in the larger Buddhist picture, showing its basis in history and morality. He explains the relationship between actual practice and the ideals expressed in sermons and in the paradoxical stories of early masters in such a way that a beginning student of Chan/Zen can then read the sermons with a deeper understanding of their relevance to his or her life. Aided by a masterful introduction by well-known scholar Dan Stevenson, this work brings introductory books on Chan/Zen to a new level of sophistication, accuracy and relevance to both the more advanced and the novice American practitioner.

In this book Linguistic Archaeology: An Introduction, he lets us take part in his adventures of recovering stone-age and medieval history by analysis of language.Analyzing the place names of the Odyssey, he made the interesting discovery that names and words may be interpreted as a shorthand, having been agglutinated from core words of the Basque language. He identified a subset of the Basque language, the core words of which have come through five millennia in almost unchanged form, as the nearest equivalent of the Neolithic universal language which has been spoken in Europe and the Near East before the 'Babylonian speech confusion.'Applying his new decoding method to names and words from many other language families, he arrived at the startling result that words of ancient languages like Sanskrit and Sumerian as well as of modern European languages like English, Spanish or German, can be decoded by the same method into Basque sentences revealing hidden meaning. This discovery is supporting the hypothesis of monogenesis of languages, according to Genesis 11.1: &#x22;...now the whole earth had one language...&#x22;As ancient words and names have come with meanings attached to them which cannot be substantiated by the hidden meaning decoded from them, a great deal of falsified or censored history can be recovered, revealing that many languages have been invented from the universal language, according to Genesis 11.7: &#x22;...come, let us go down and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.&#x22;","genres":["Ancient Civilizations","Instruction","Hinduism","Foreign Language Study & Reference","History","Mesopotamia","Linguistics","Words, Language & Grammar","Reference","Religion & Spirituality","Europe","Foreign Language Dictionaries & Thesauruses","Language Instruction","Assyria, Babylonia & Sumer"]}

But overall, Collins's wonderfully illuminating, engrossing analysis illustrates, through the century there was a move toward endorsing increasingly exuberant expansion. Looking at history through the lens of economic growth, Collins puts postwar American society in a whole new perspective. A professor of history at the University of Missouri-Columbia, Collins tells the story of American economic growth as it waxed and waned and waxed again from the New Deal through the Clinton administration. Early on, he argues, many Americans questioned whether growth was possible or even desirable in a mature capitalist economy. WWII, however, set the country's economic engine in motion, and after WWII, &#x22;growthmanship&#x22; gained speed, reaching an apex in Kennedy and Johnson's &#x22;growth liberalism.&#x22; Economic expansion backslid between 1973 and 1985, as heavy government investment in Vietnam and the Great Society programs led to rapid inflation; price stability took priority. Nixon's &#x22;progressive conservativism&#x22; unsuccessfully tried to rekindle enthusiasm for robust economic growth by linking it to streamlined government and the moral rejuvenation of America. In the mid-1980s, Reagan's supply-side tactics succeeded in stealing the growth issue from the Democrats, repackaging it and recasting the GOP as the party of economic growth. Only then did Americans seemingly overcome their ambivalence about abundance. More recently, Clinton's eclectic and pragmatic approach to sustaining growth has put limits on it. Brilliantly original, this study demonstrates how different groups--from liberals to Cold Warriors--used economic growth to further their own ends, sometimes with disastrous or unforeseen consequences.

Although such a gang may contain a core group, many more are made up of fringe members, he asserts, and there is overlap among gangs. A large number of gangs have a criminal orientation, and their crimes have traditionally been against property. Gangs' major activity, according to the author, has been inactivity. But in recent times, the number of street gangs has grown enormously, he shows, with gangs now found in at least 800 American cities, their growth abetted by media attention and inept law enforcement officials. But as the gang culture has spread across the nation, the seriousness of its crimes has increased, with hundreds of homicides yearly in L.A. alone. Though written by a scholar who has studied street gangs for 30 years, this telling commentary is generally free of academic jargon.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.","genres":["Children's Books","Politics & Social Sciences","Linguistics","Crime & Criminals","Words, Language & Grammar","Reference","Social Sciences","Children's eBooks","Sociology","Criminology"]}

Making innovative use of material from such (apparently) diverse sources as anthropology, linguistics, travel literature and cinema, North's brisk but densely researched book moves engagingly around its central thesis: that later critics have slanted the reception history of modernism to fit into their own ideas of what it represented.&#x22;--Times Literary Supplement&#x22;It is nevertheless surprising... just how much ground [North]isable to cover (and cover well) in under three hundred pages.

Where the emphasis in other series is on plain and straightforward language, Cambridge English Reading texts typically use very modern expressions and the dialogue is faster moving. This has an impact on the quality of the audio cassettes, which make for very enjoyable listening.'  David R. Hill, Survey Review: Readers, ELT Journal'It was only a matter of time before a major ELT publisher set out to challenge the market dominance of Penguin Classics in the area of readers ... CUP have hit back admirably. With something for everyone in your classes, this series is well worth investing in. In fact, it's going to be a difficult act to follow by other publishers.' IATEFL Issues'The series breaks new ground in two respects. The first is the light and informal style of writing. It is notoriously difficult to write fluent prose using restricted lexis and syntax. Part of the secret is to use word and grammar lists flexibly; but it requires flair and a good ear to produce prose and dialogue that read so well and give such a genuine flavour of modern idiom.' English Teaching Professional'These were a very good read: exciting fast-moving stories at all levels, and a good mixture of subjects. Most touched on up-to-date themes, such as corruption, refugees, psychology, hunger, feminism, or ecology without being prosy, or moralising.' BaNina Vivanco, SATEFL Newsletter Vol 19 No 3'This is a well presented, authentic looking  series of readers that students should enjoy.

Though written mostly for those with strong theological interests. Sweeney presents enough of the personal context to sustain a narrative.&#x22;--Theology Today","categories":[["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Churches & Church Leadership","Church History"],["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","History"],["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Theology"],["Books","History","Americas","United States","Colonial Period"],["Books","History","World","Religious","Christianity"],["Books","Religion & Spirituality","Religious Studies","Theology"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","History","Americas","United States","Colonial Period"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Churches & Church Leadership"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","History"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Theology"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Religious Studies & Reference","Theology"]],"genres":["Christianity","Christian Books & Bibles","History","Churches & Church Leadership","World","Colonial Period","Theology","Religion & Spirituality","Americas","United States","Religious Studies & Reference","Religious","Church History","Religious Studies"]}

Where the emphasis in other series is on plain and straightforward language, Cambridge English Reading texts typically use very modern expressions and the dialogue is faster moving. This has an impact on the quality of the audio cassettes, which make for very enjoyable listening.'  David R. Hill, Survey Review: Readers, ELT Journal'It was only a matter of time before a major ELT publisher set out to challenge the market dominance of Penguin Classics in the area of readers ... CUP have hit back admirably. With something for everyone in your classes, this series is well worth investing in. In fact, it's going to be a difficult act to follow by other publishers.' IATEFL Issues'The series breaks new ground in two respects. The first is the light and informal style of writing. It is notoriously difficult to write fluent prose using restricted lexis and syntax. Part of the secret is to use word and grammar lists flexibly; but it requires flair and a good ear to produce prose and dialogue that read so well and give such a genuine flavour of modern idiom.' English Teaching Professional'These were a very good read: exciting fast-moving stories at all levels, and a good mixture of subjects. Most touched on up-to-date themes, such as corruption, refugees, psychology, hunger, feminism, or ecology without being prosy, or moralising.' BaNina Vivanco, SATEFL Newsletter Vol 19 No 3'This is a well presented, authentic looking  series of readers that students should enjoy. They are graded into five levels, and the accompanying cassette will be useful, especially for pronunciation - audio versions are very popular with students.'

She has created interesting, real characters and the plot raises many social issues as well as being a good read. This book will open many people's eyes. RUNNING SCARED is a good multi-layered book that has mass appeal - it has something for everyone to enjoy. --Zpidre - Romance Junkies http://www.romancejunkiesreviews.com/artman/publish/contemporary/Running_Scared.shtmlRipe with tension and suspense, Running Scared reads like a fast-paced romantic suspense with plenty of mystery added. Fantastically descriptive scenery from Asia is abundant throughout the book. Explanations of the gem trade and how it works give the reader a bird's eye view of this industry. Beautifully erotic in the extreme, the love between Mitch and Julie is something to be savored. I cannot wait for Ms. Nicholas' next novel! --Regina - Coffee Time Romance http://www.coffeetimeromance.com/BookReviews/Runningscared.htmlThis is an enticing story, set in different international and exotic locales, with a passionate and sexy couple. At times, there are so many things happening that the story doesn't feel large enough to accommodate it all.Summary: Gemologist Julie Marchant and Mitch Cartwright meet at a Red Cross charity ball in Sydney. There's an instant attraction, and Julie thinks this might actually lead to something lasting. But her hopes are dashed when, after they spend the night together, she wakes up alone and never hears from Mitch. Several weeks later, Julie is on a trip to buy sapphires in Laos and is shocked to run into Mitch, who turns out to be an archaeologist working on a job there. The two quickly pick up where they left off but have to deal with multiple problems, including murder and civil unrest. They each learn a lot about themselves and, in turn, discover what is most important to them. --Romantic Times - http://www.romantictimes.com/authors_profile.php?author=16015","price":{"$numberDouble":"4.24"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517CzkWX1IL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B001RTC0H4","B000XFL9WK","B00AK3GTTI","B002GEDEVK","B000JMKU0Y","B0016IXMDW","B009VTIGWU","B00J436CN8","B00D8MYCTM","B003DX0I9O","B001CNR8HW","B008Z436F4","B00309SCV2","B00AQ2A86S","B009L5XZ6G"],"buy_after_viewing":["B001RTC0H4","B009VTIGWU"]},"categories":[["Books","Biographies & Memoirs","Specific Groups","Women"],["Books","Literature & Fiction"],["Books","Romance","Contemporary"],["Books","Romance","Fantasy"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Romance","Contemporary"]],"genres":["Women","Specific Groups","Fantasy","Romance","Biographies & Memoirs","Contemporary","Literature & Fiction"]}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963ba8"},"asin":"B000RG1O1Q","description":"FromCompetitive Intelligence Magazine, May/Jun 2008, by John J. McGonagle:&quot;All CI analysts worth their salt should own. read and master (both of their) books. Once having mastered them, keep them handy for their encyclopedic and crystal clear way in which each dissects the pros and cons of critical CI analysis tools, and explains how to use, when to use, and when not to use each of them.&quot;This comprehensive compendium of methods to analyze business and competition does a yeoman&#39;s job of providing practical, useful pointers to executives.&nbsp;-- R. Subramanian, Montclair State University (Reprinted with permission from CHOICE, copyright by the American Library Association)&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x22;Too much data and not enough insight? Fleisher and Bensoussan offer a fabulous solution to the problem.Business and Competitive Analysisprovides a nice combination of theory and practice, including a comprehensive, wide-ranging description of analytical techniques. Providing a strong complement to their previous work,Strategic and Competitive Analysis, this latest work is a &#x22;must read&#x22; for anyone analyzing strategic and tactical issues across the competitive landscape.&#x22;--Timothy J. Kindler, Director, Competitive Intelligence, Eastman Kodak Company and 2005 President, Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals&#x22;This book (Business and Competitive Analysis: Effective Application of New and Classic Methods) is an essential resource for competitive intelligence practitioners, business school students, and anyone looking to improve the strength and clarity of their competitive and market analyses. While no tool will perform analysis for you, the techniques explained here will provide inspiration, structure, and discipline for those who need to deliver compelling analysis to decision makers. I believe that this book will fill a great need for both full-time competitive intelligence practitioners and those looking to add analytical skills to their managerial tool kit.&#x22;--Bill Fiora, Partner and Founder, Outward Insights&nbsp;&ldquo;Anything which improves business and competitive analysis practice has to be applauded. Too frequently &#x22;strategy&#x22; type texts include just the bare minimum and even then the familiar old models would appear, with little explanation, hardly any critique, and even less insight. Unlike these, Fleisher and Bensoussan offer a full and unique demonstration of how to successfully cross the divide between theory and practice. All practicing managers and business decision makers should be grateful to Fleisher and Bensoussan for showing them how their analysis work can become more rigorous and their approach less casual. Accept no imitations. This is the genuine article.&rdquo;--Sheila Wright, Director of the Competitive Intelligence-Marketing Interface Teaching and Research Initiative (CIMITRI) at Leicester Business School, De Montfort University&nbsp;&#x22;Baruch&#39;s Law reminds us that, &#39;when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail,&#39; a condition describing the single most difficult challenge facing both business analysts and consultants, novice and veteran alike. In 2003, Fleisher and Bensoussan delivered what all leading intelligence thinkers agree was THE definitive guide to analytics and interpretation for the first half-decade of the new millennium. With their latest collaboration, this expert duo has defined the second-half of this decade as one guided by knowing the tools appropriate for the cognitive task at hand while expanding the toolkit available to be even more complete, valuable, and useful through the actionable detailing of 24 all new techniques. Plus, the unique FAROUT approach to tool selection equips analysts to quickly and easily apply the right techniques more reliably and scientifically to the range of outcomes anticipated in every business-decision support situation.&#x22;--Arik Johnson, Managing Director, Aurora WDC&nbsp;&ldquo;The realm of competitive intelligence has, in recent years, benefited from a profusion of books, handbooks, and essays, most of which deal with issues in intelligence collection: emerging techniques and technologies and general overviews of the business intelligence discipline. Fleisher and Bensoussan offer a choice of analytical models destined to narrow corporate course charting uncertainties and present a convincing case for matching science and art in the analysis process. This new book is an important addition to the definitive professional library on the art and science of business intelligence.&rdquo;--Michael Belkine, Managing Director, Splendour Ltd&nbsp;&#x22;Having been involved in information analysis and strategic information support to companies for many years, I found this book&nbsp;very helpful and full of insights addressed not only to&nbsp;the new-comer, but also to an experienced person.The in depth review of each&nbsp;analysis technique actually brings&nbsp;new ways of looking at&nbsp;problems: information analysis becomes an instrument in the&nbsp;hands of a thinking person; it&#39;s not&nbsp;an academic exercise or just a conceptual framework.Furthermore, in my experience usually some of the analysis techniques are&nbsp;almost known and used only by people&nbsp;working in a few functions inside a company. This book enters you in a fascinating multi-stage and multi-face analysis world: everyone needs a way of organizing&nbsp;thoughts, and here you can find what you require to perform a good analysis and give insightful meanings to the information you manage, wherever you work in&nbsp;your company, whatever the problem you face is.Every day everyone needs to analyze information to understand phenomena and then act to achieve the best performance: hence you need to keep this book on your desk.&rdquo;--Milena Motta, Managing Director, Strategie&amp;Innovazione, Italy&nbsp;&#x22;There are very few books I recommend as a must-read to the managers who come to us from all over the world for professional training in competitive intelligence. Porter, Fuld, Gilad (of course), and Fleisher and Bensoussan.&#x22;--Dr. Benjamin Gilad, president, The Fuld-Gilad-Herring Academy of Competitive intelligence, www.academyci.com&nbsp;&#x22;At last a comprehensive manual of tools and techniques for the business and competitive analysis professional! Fleisher and Bensoussan&#39;s second collaborative work builds beautifully on their first. It provides the specific guidance desperately needed by company analysts to ensure that decision makers receive the right information at the right time to make the right decisions.&#x22;&nbsp;--Kirk W. M. Tyson, CEO, Perpetual Strategist Ltd., Chicago, USA&nbsp;&#x22;The dynamic&nbsp;collaborative team&nbsp;of Bensoussan and Fleisher have done it again.&nbsp;Expanding on their earlier text,Strategic and Competitive Analysis, the&nbsp;refined perspectives offered in their latest work,Business and Competitive Analysis, have raised the bar for&nbsp;essential literature in the&nbsp;profession of decision support.&nbsp;By artfully interweaving&nbsp;both pragmatic and theoretic principles, this book&nbsp;couples&nbsp;frameworks for&nbsp;critical thinking&nbsp;with practical operational guidance for the&nbsp;successful analyst. They never lose sight of the ultimate end game--sustainable competitive advantage through sound, evidence-based decision making. Very few&nbsp;enterprises&nbsp;seem capable of achieving this elusive objective in the hypercompetitive business environment of the 21st century.&nbsp;These thought leaders have built another pillar in the foundation of the business intelligence literature base&nbsp;which should be required reading&nbsp;in&nbsp;both&nbsp;academic and corporate settings.&#x22;&nbsp;--Clifford Kalb, Vice President, Life Sciences, Wood Mackenzie, Inc.&nbsp;&ldquo;Business and Competitive Analysis: Effective Application of New and Classic Methodsfrom Fleisher and Bensoussan is &#39;the definitive must have&#39; for anyone undertaking competitive analysis, irrespective of experience, practitioner, or third party vendor. This practical and actionable set of techniques grows and develops the agenda of the first edition by extending the range of techniques, focusing on their actionability rather than a statement of their intent and allows the practitioner to hit the nail on the head with at times complex problems and their recommendations. Through the consistent approach adopted with the techniques it provides the guide to what can be achieved and how and helps structure the problem from the very outset. The FAROUT methodology again helps the practitioner work out which ones to apply first given their own unique position and provides a development framework to seek out opportunities to apply the rest. Like the first edition, it becomes the most sought after next installment in defining competitive analysis&#39; role in business for practitioner and user alike.&rdquo;--Andrew Beurschgens, Competitive Analysis Manager, Orange, UK&nbsp;&ldquo;Bravo! Bensoussan and Fleisher have returned for an encore performance as your instructive desktop guides to thoughtfully assist analysts of all stripes in selecting and applying a wide-ranging array of frameworks, all designed to enhance analytical thinking, insight, and decision-making. This second volume, following their wildly successful first book, delivers exactly what it promises--to assist analysts in developing high value insights, to aid them in making sense of the competitive environment ...","price":{"$numberDouble":"18.49"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SwDq8pxtL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B008J8RCTW","B00KQOQI9W","B000OVLJSC","B0075LZ0FM","B009CFL9MC","B00LMR1D92","B009G10CLQ","B00KMFAX0U","B00AQTTLVE","B004I1KRUK","B004I1KRUA","B004I1KRTQ","B00LLXY3C6","B005JKEMQY","B00CM9V826","B00L9FY7Y0","B004I1KRU0","B00DGV2V3O","B008CG87GI","B00AU3JPDA","B00968FRBY","B002M3SXQG","B007VONQYK","B0089EM3GI","B00CHTEMUG","B009NW9NTA","B008GBCG0C","B002RMSZ1U","B001EWEB5I","B00A7CTPNY","B00DD38EYU","B009PM8XOY","B00I12X4N4","B005YV7BTS","B00555X8OA","B009NI36WE","B00COGYQOE","B0051TW0QC","B00EAQTKPQ","B00DV9Q3C6","B008O7V05U","B00K08UA02","B00892BFEQ","B00APDAT3A","B00CXQ8KGA","B008N0TP3C","B00KEFZTB6","B005CAPKWQ","B00COGYQN0","B007ZSZNC0","B00LJAK7I0","B001M60BKU","B00COGYQRQ","B00LE1YTN8","B005Z57E18","B00COGYQOO","B00968FOTO","B004YWBBK8","B00JP4228A","B007AHUYZC","B00AU3JU8U","B00L8HE20S","B0054KOKZ2","B0068U4IU4","B00COGYQZI","B00APRRRYA","B0027976HC","B00DEOGIG4","B0082LJ01O","B00LGX4JFC"],"buy_after_viewing":["B009CFL9MC","B0075LZ0FM","B001CB34J0","B00B0SA1LY"]},"categories":[["Books","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Decision-Making & Problem Solving"],["Books","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Systems & Planning"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Decision-Making & Problem Solving"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Systems & Planning"]],"genres":["Decision-Making & Problem Solving","Management & Leadership","Business & Money","Systems & Planning"]}

Alison Blunt develops a post-structuralist perspective on travel writing which remains sensitive to questions of authorship and subjectivity. Drawing on feminist and post-colonial cultural theory, she constructs a sophisticated account of the ambivalent subject positions of Mary Kingsley within the public and private spheres of late Victorian Britain. By situating Kingsley's writings in the wider context of gendered discourses of 'home' and 'away', the book offers a new perspective on both travel writing and the culture of imperialism more generally.&#x22; --Felix Driver, Royal Holloway, University of London&#x22;Alison Blunt's fascinating study of Mary Kinglsey offers new insights into the social and intellectual context of British imperialism. By drawing upon poststructuralist and feminist theories, she provides a stimulating and scholarly commentary upon the complex relations between Western women and the empire, the nature of nineteenth century British geography and the place of women in the subject's history.

Most Western works on Eisenstein concentrate on his  silent films of the 1920s, which are routinely taught in  introductory film classes as textbook examples of the montage  style of editing. While this collection discusses the importance  of this technique, which Eisenstein is usually credited with  creating, it seeks to explore the director's later works and  writings in as much depth. LaValley (film studies, Dartmouth)  and Scherr (Russian, Dartmouth) have collected a wide range of  essays, covering topics from the impact of the Orthodox Church  on the director's work to the influence Eisenstein had on  British directors. Several contributions by academics from the  former Soviet Union, as well as many essays by professors of  Russian literature, make this collection valuable to students of  Russian language and literature as well as to the expected  audience of film theorists. This collection will be of use to  academic libraries with a film studies collection and to large  public libraries.

In part one of her book, Fowler reminds readers that ADHD is a result of neurobiological events that affect a teen's actions, &#x22;rather than deliberate choice or stupidity,&#x22; and provides an overview of the disorder and the available medical treatments. In part two, she skillfully guides parents through various ADHD-related issues how to decide which medical treatment to pursue and what to do if the teen is uncooperative; sexuality; money management; schoolwork; college searches; jobs; legal issues stressing that while there is still no cure, parents can help their teenage sons and daughters measurably improve the quality of their lives. A former secondary-school teacher and tireless advocate for children with ADHD, their parents and their teachers, Fowler is not the smoothest writer, but her personal voice offers a welcome respite from the parade of experts quoted. Providing a wealth of realistic, compassionate strategies and tactics for caring for an adolescent with ADHD, Fowler has created an all-encompassing yet easy-to-use guide. Parents would be wise to read this book from cover to cover first and then refer to the &#x22;information links&#x22; or special highlighted sections that lead to more in-depth information as necessary.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963bba"},"asin":"B000RH0E84","description":"opular evangelical preacher and author Palau appealingly covers well-worn territory in this compilation of inspirational stories. In his introduction, Palau distinguishes between his titular &#x22;pictures&#x22; and &#x22;portraits&#x22; by explaining that some of the vignettes are more like pictures, or snapshots, of God's concern with &#x22;short-term details,&#x22; while others are portraits that demonstrate God's work in someone's life over a long period of time. Despite this distinction, each chapter is no more than four pages long, regardless of its scope. The brevity of these stories, as well as their feel-good subject matter (i.e., the much-needed check that appears in the mail, the mysterious stranger who disappears after doing a good deed, the urge to pray for someone at what turns out to be a moment of peril, etc.), makes this book palatable reading for those with the shortest of attention spans. Moreover, despite the author's unabashed evangelicalism he often focuses on born-again experiences and distinguishes between the saved and the hellbound his warm, folksy tone will probably appeal to nonevangelical readers. Sophisticated readers of all theological persuasions might suspect that Palau has taken liberties with these stories, perhaps even blurring the line between the truth and urban legend. Nevertheless, there is no reason to doubt his earnest desire to relay to a wide audience the amazing stories people have told him through the years. He does this very well, and even the most cynical reader will likely be moved.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.","price":{"$numberDouble":"9.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DWM7kM6KL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_viewed":["B0086I7VQY","B007RY2Y7O","B004L62B74"],"buy_after_viewing":["B00DNBECDO"]},"categories":[["Books","Religion & Spirituality","Spirituality","Inspirational"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Spirituality","Inspirational"]],"genres":["Religion & Spirituality","Inspirational","Spirituality"]}

The book focuses on the increasingly requested esthetic procedures such as crown lengthening and root coverage, but it also deals with other mucogingival operations, such as hard and soft pre-prosthetic and pre-implant ridge augmentation. Uniquely, there is also a focus on the burgeoning field of periodontal microsurgery, and the techniques and methods learned from other branches of microsurgery are applied to realities of dentistry, for enhanced soft tissue results.Practical Periodontal Plastic Surgerybegins by outlining the place and development of periodontal plastic surgery, and the factors, chiefly periodontal health, that affect surgical outcomes. Periodontal microsurgery is then introduced before the step-by-step description of the surgical procedures with their expected outcome. Each operation is taken in turn, explaining the techniques used and the instrumentation required, and illustrating every step with an abundance of clinical photographs. Finally, the book concludes with a discussion of patient selection criteria.This book will benefit periodontists, dentists, residents and students alike by strengthening understanding of mucogingival surgery through a thorough appreciation of each part of the procedures involved.","price":{"$numberDouble":"131.49"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41sMeElb23L._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B005BR0JEE","B005HQI00Y","B00BG9M3HC","B00CWZ7FD6","B00960HCNS","B006W86B4S","B00C3M4ABI","B005I3PD9M","B00CWZ9F3Y","B005BR0I6S","B005C66Z0Q","B00BFX6JFG"],"buy_after_viewing":["B005BR0JEE"]},"categories":[["Books","Medical Books","Dentistry","Periodontics"],["Books","Medical Books","Medicine","Surgery","Plastic"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Medical eBooks","Dentistry","Periodontics"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Medical eBooks","Specialties","Surgery","Plastic & Cosmetic"]],"genres":["Specialties","Surgery","Medical eBooks","Plastic","Medicine","Professional & Technical","Plastic & Cosmetic","Medical Books","Dentistry","Periodontics"]}

The gap between research and practice can sometimes be bridged by providing teachers with a resource that translates research into a practical &#x22;how-to&#x22; format. Drs. Shapiro and Cole have created such a resource in this text. They have done so through a balance of both scholarly and applied information, so that educators know the &#x22;whys&#x22; as well as the &#x22;hows&#x22; of self-management.&#x22; --Charles A. Hughes, Ph.D., Penn State University&#x22;The problems educators are facing today are enormous. Traditional strategies are not sufficient to address our contemporary challenges. We need to identify and cultivate innovative strategies that hold promise for classroom use.Self-Management Interventions for Classroom Behavior Changeby Shapiro and Cole does an outstanding job of presenting practitioners with a review of self-management intervention strategies. These methods enable students to play a more active role in improving their own academic achievement and classroom behaviors. The authors present in both a clear and useful manner descriptions of various self-management classroom strategies, the empirical support for these strategies, and practical issue involved in designing and implementing these strategies. These authors have done an excellent job of showing how research demonstrations of self-management technology can be translated into effective practice.&#x22; --John W. Fantuzzo, Ph.D., University of Pennsylvania&#x22;Students that are self-motivated, responsible, and self-directed is what everyone wants for their students, but these are characteristics that are hard to attain. These are difficult concepts to define and even more difficult to teach. Ed Shapiro's and Chris Cole's new book on self-management reads like a road map in practically teaching these skills to the most difficult students. This book is scholarly, but at the same time gives step-by-step instructions in teaching self-management for academic performance, problem solving, stress management, and social skills. I highly recommend the book for regular and special educators for classroom. It is also an excellent tool for guidance personnel who want to make a meaningful impact in educating students to be more self-directed and responsible. This book is a practical gem.&#x22; --William R.

Richardson, Jr. was born in Portland, Maine on August 22, 1921. His family moved to South Portland in 1925, where he has lived since that time. He is a graduate of South Portland High School and Bowdoin College. He took courses at the University of Paris while serving with the Army in 1945 and after the War he attended Northeastern University Law School on the GI Bill, graduating in 1950.His activities as a member of the United States Army in the Second World War, including extensive combat experience, are documented in this book. He received the Combat Infantry Badge for the European Theater and North Atlantic Theater of Operations ribbons.Mr. Richardson was admitted to the Maine Bar in 1950 and became associated with a law firm specializing in insurance company defense work. His law practice soon branched out into a variety of fields including real estate and probate law and a specialization in conservation law.In addition to his law practice Mr. Richardson also operated an insurance photography business, taught Constitutional Law at the Portland University Law School, and was a Field Investigator for the American Bar Foundation in connection with legal representation for indigent defendants in the Maine criminal courts. He has served on both state and local boards and commissions relating to the environment. As a lawyer Mr. Richardson is most noted for his pioneering work in the formation and development of several conservation organizations, most notably The Nature Conservancy, to which he devoted thirty years as counsel, trustee and officer. He wrote Maine's first Conservation Easement statute, was a founding member and secretary of the organization that pushed through the referendum that resulted in the acquisition of the Bigelow Mountain Range as a public domain, and he is the author of a history of the Maine chapter of The Nature Conservancy published in 1989.Since his high school years Mr. Richardson has been an avid photographer and some of his wartime photographs are included in this book. He has taught and lectured in the field of nature photography and has made a particular specialty of black and white photography, developing and printing his own work since 1935. His photographs have been exhibited and published from time to time and he has received numerous awards for his photographic work.His interests and hobbies over the years, in addition to photography, have included hiking, camping and mountain climbing. Throughout his life he has had a passionate interest in classical music and he has a substantial record collection.","categories":[["Books","Biographies & Memoirs","Leaders & Notable People","Military","World War II"],["Books","History","Military","World War II"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Biographies & Memoirs","Leaders & Notable People","Military"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Biographies & Memoirs","Professionals & Academics","Military & Spies"]],"genres":["Professionals & Academics","Military & Spies","History","Biographies & Memoirs","World War II","Leaders & Notable People","Military"]}

Even though Jezer ( The Dark Ages: Life in the United States, 1945-1960 ) clearly respects Hoffman's ability to mobilize dissenters, he does not shirk from challenging Hoffman's attention-getting tactics, often perceived as clownish or macho. Jezer contends that the Jewish Hoffman's upbringing in conservative, largely non-Jewish, working-class Worcester, Mass., taught him to accept people of varied backgrounds and contributed to his energetic support of civil rights. His youth also led him to adopt a &#x22;tough hood&#x22; stance that he never abandoned, and that did not allow him to fully practice nonviolence. Hoffman's formative education in radicalism at Brandeis and Berkeley, his support of antiwar political candidates and his founding of the politicized Yippie movement on Manhattan's Lower East Side are discussed. Anecdotal accounts of demonstrations are here in abundance; much attention is given to &#x22;guerrilla theater,&#x22; police brutality and Hoffman's problems with the law on a cocaine-dealing charge. Little is made of his life outside the political arena, but the manic depression that led him to commit suicide in 1989, at age 53, is shown to have been an ever-present, worsening condition.

The Zionist training farm was organized to prepare Jews for emigration to Palestine. One of the founders was Yeohezkel Tydor, the author's father, who died in 1993. Baumel's narration of the kibbutz's history is divided into two sections. Part one examines the kibbutz from its creation until the departure of the founding group to Palestine in late summer 1945. Part two traces the kibbutz's subsequent history in Palestine and Germany, from the autumn of 1945 until the mid-1950s. Kibbutz Buchenwald was abolished in Germany in 1948; the kibbutz as it was founded in what is now Israel--named Netzer Sereni--still exists today. The story of these pioneers and their physical, psychological, ideological, and political struggles forms the nucleus of this absorbing book.George Cohen","genres":["Politics & Social Sciences","History","World","Social Sciences","Religion & Spirituality","Holocaust","Religious","Jewish","Judaism"]}

But a few weeks later, the neighborhood had another impromptu celebration when my mom, who had previously given birth to four boys in eight years, finally gave birth to her first girl, me. A little over a year later, she did it again: had another boy. To say the male influence in my life has been tremendous is an understatement. Outnumbered but not outsmarted, all I wanted was a second bathroom!A Charles Dickens' novel describes my life: &#x22;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times....&#x22; Living a block away from the main library made my natural quest for knowledge a reality of great expectations. Grinding poverty could have made for a bleak house, but the love of our family helped overcome much adversity.Through a series of serendipitous experiences, I came to the realization that there is a Divine Being, with a sense of humor, guiding my life. Born in Ohio, but living in various states, such as New York, Arizona, California, Florida, and Hawaii, I have an appreciation for the beauty and diversity of the landscape and the people of North America. As an older &#x22;Baby Boomer&#x22; with a husband who's been my mate for nearly 40 years and 2 grown children, a girl and a boy, it's been quite an adventure.But my daughter giving birth to my one and only grandchild, a boy named Kevie Keanu, added a new color to the rainbow of my life. I write, so that he will know what came before....my experience is a treasure and my gift to him and his generation.","categories":[["Books","Biographies & Memoirs","Memoirs"],["Books","Humor & Entertainment","Humor"],["Kindle Store","Kindle Short Reads","Two hours or more (65-100 pages)","Biographies & Memoirs"],["Kindle Store","Kindle Short Reads","Two hours or more (65-100 pages)","Humor & Entertainment"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Biographies & Memoirs"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Humor & Entertainment","Humor"]],"genres":["Humor","Humor & Entertainment","Two hours or more (65-100 pages)","Memoirs","Kindle Short Reads","Biographies & Memoirs"]}

He begins by advising new managers that they must now develop a new mind-set, and he describes the various roles a manager must assume. He then offers tips on the different tasks a manager performs: time management; goal setting and planning; leadership; team building; decision making; delegating; hiring and orienting new employees; motivation; performance appraisal; discipline, grievance handling, and termination; and communication.

Prud'homme, who first reported on ImClone for Vanity Fair, reminds readers of the bigger story, the one that set the financial hijinx in motion: ImClone's failed attempt to bring a potentially groundbreaking cancer medication, Erbitux, to market. This story tells of scientists like John Mendelsohn, who led the research into C225, the antibody at the heart of Erbitux, and patients like Shannon Kellum, a 28-year-old woman diagnosed with colon cancer for whom the medication was a &#x22;miracle drug&#x22; that added a few years to her life. She was one of the rare lucky ones; Prud'homme's reporting is especially strong when he delves into the seemingly haphazard way in which ImClone distributed C225 for &#x22;compassionate use&#x22; during the clinical testing period. The FDA's rejection of ImClone's &#x22;scientifically incomplete&#x22; test data was the immediate motivation for Waksal's crimes, but Prud'homme's portrayal suggests it was completely in character for the reckless social-climbing executive, described by acquaintances as a &#x22;pathological liar&#x22; who cared more about making money than about curing cancer. Prud'homme ends his compelling account with Waksal's sentencing, and even though he'll inevitably have to update the paperback to wrap up coverage of the Martha Stewart trial, it's well worth reading the book now to appreciate what's really at stake in ImClone's downfall.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He traces the genesis of the policy to the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, which made efforts at nondiscrimination in public works projects and the military. The Civil Rights movement birthed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as well as lingering questions about how to prove discrimination, how to enforce antidiscrimination orders and whether preferences were needed to overcome past discrimination. The zenith of affirmative action, it turns out, came under Richard Nixon, whose secretary of labor, George Shultz, required federal contractors to set goals and targets for minority employment. The concept soon wound up in the courts, and Anderson provides good summaries of relevant cases, from the 1978Bakkedecision to last year's cases involving the University of Michigan. The backlash began in the 1980s, under Ronald Reagan, as enforcement lagged and the Justice Department sought cases to curtail affirmative action. In the 1990s, the rhetoric shifted to &#x22;diversity,&#x22; an easier concept for politicians to embrace, and university systems in California and Texas were forced to give up preferences. (The winners at select universities: Asians.) Many cities and businesses have institutionalized the policy, and affirmative action has created a very different workplace in 40 years&#x97;with little damage to firm competitiveness or fair employment practices, says the author. Still, Anderson concludes by acknowledging a host of questions about whom the policy should help. Though Anderson aims at an evenhanded tone, he could have paid more attention to notable polemics on this topic. He omits examination of affirmative action programs in the U.S. military and would have done well to at least note some international experiences.

His arguments are compelling. The author has brought old insights into a comprehensive synthesis and given us new perspectives, or &#x22;handles,&#x22; by which to focus our attention on the greater picture of writing, literacy, scribes, and literary texts in the ancient world.&#x22; --Cathoic Biblical Quarterly&#x22;Exceptionally erudite and readable. Biblical scholars will need to seriously consider this well laid out challenge to the generally accepted theories of documentary sources.&#x22; --Review of Biblical Literature&#x22;Writing on the Tablet of the Heartis a stimulating analysis of classical religious texts that were essential to the enculturation of elite transmitters of tradition. Its adept handling of the data implicit in comparative texts from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece, together with those from Qumran, illuminates the emergence of the Bible and suggests a way to revitalize Scripture today.&#x22;--James L. Crenshaw, Robert L. Flowers Professor of Old Testament, Duke University&#x22;InWriting on the Tablet of the HeartDavid Carr draws on a vast range of evidence to explore writing and the socialization of elites in the ancient Near East and the Hellenistic world. This impressive work contributes vitally to breaking down the distinction between literacy and orality which has often clouded discussions of cultural and administrative institutions in the ancient world, and reaches significant conclusions that will have an impact far beyond its core area of Biblical Studies.&#x22;--John Baines, Professor of Egyptology, University of Oxford&#x22;Carr spans the ancient Near East with enviable ease, bringing together scholars and debates from diverse disciplines. His cross-cultural analysis will stimulate new insights into areas which readers know well, while it also offers intriguing glimpses into new territory.&#x22; --Teresa Morgan, Fellow in Ancient History, Oriel College, Oxford&#x22;David Carr'sWriting on the Tablet of the Heartprovides a fresh and highly readable account of the contexts and conditions which progressively shaped ancient Israel's textual heritage as scripture.  Carr adroitly employs an impressively broad range of comparative and theoretical perspectives to argue for the centrality of an oral-written textual practice in the educational process of cultural formation and socialization in elite Israelite circles.  While this book is must reading for students and scholars of the Hebrew Bible, both in its literary formation and social reception, Carr's reach extends to other cultural fields in which orality and textuality are performatively bound.&#x22;--Steven D. Fraade, Mark Taper Professor of the History of Judaism, Yale University&#x22;David Carr has given us an extremely thorough study of the modes of textual transmission that has far-reaching implications for our study of the Pentateuch and the composition of biblical literature. Using a comparative and anthropological approach,Writing on the Tablet of the Heartbreaks new ground in understanding the implications of orality and literacy in the formation of Scripture. This well-written and carefully researched book deserves to be a standard work for anyone interested in the Bible.&#x22; --William Schniedewind, author ofHow the Bible Became a Book","genres":["Sacred Writings","Old Testament","Christian Books & Bibles","Bible Study & Reference","Reference","Religion & Spirituality","Hebrew Bible (Old Testament)","Criticism & Interpretation","Judaism","Exegesis & Hermeneutics"]}

The cause of the small band of black slaves who had mutinied during transport off Cuba and eventually washed up on Long Island (1839) temporarily united disparate factions of the fledgling abolitionist movement.

The dramatically high failure rate -- estimated at 60 to 75% -- suggests that alliance managers often lack the knowledge and skills to determine strategic fit, negotiate win-win agreements, align organizational cultures, and -- perhaps most important of all -- get people to work together productively. This book provides the practical guidance needed to make alliances work. InThe Strongest Link, strategic alliance experts Slowinski and Sagal draw on over 40 years of experience working with companies to form strong, profitable collaborations, including AT&amp;T, NEC, Battelle, Eli Lilly, and Procter &amp; Gamble. Packed with stories of these and other companies, the book features exclusive, proven methodologies for planning, structuring, and negotiating an alliance, as well as strategies for training participants in collaborative management.The Strongest Linkis a true field guide, a down-in-the-trenches look at how to avoid the troubles that plague so many alliance efforts and how to forge a collaborative link that adds value to all participants.&quot;","price":{"$numberDouble":"13.2"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WwLZRsHML._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B004OEIQ2M","B00BU5G6HU","B006V879WC","B00HVGGH76","B0087GJ8KM","B003D87PJ0","B0094J7S9Y","B0064EHZY0","B00AJVJ1HI"],"buy_after_viewing":["B004OEIQ2M"]},"categories":[["Books","Business & Money","Finance"],["Books","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Consolidation & Merger"],["Books","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Management"],["Books","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Strategy & Competition"],["Books","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Systems & Planning"],["Books","Business & Money","Organizational Behavior","Organizational Change"],["Books","Teen & Young Adult"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Consolidation & Merger"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Management","Management Skills"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Management","Strategic Management"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Business & Money","Management & Leadership","Systems & Planning"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Business & Money","Organizational Behavior","Organizational Change"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Teen & Young Adult"]],"genres":["Organizational Change","Management & Leadership","Finance","Strategy & Competition","Systems & Planning","Business & Money","Management Skills","Consolidation & Merger","Strategic Management","Organizational Behavior","Teen & Young Adult","Management"]}

Wilson, Stanford University School of Medicine&#x22;In the 19th century, Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution was initially integrated into the new science of psychology by pioneers such as Lloyd Morgan, George John Romanes, and James Mark Baldwin. But in the 20th century it was as if their efforts had been wasted; a self-names &#8216;science&#8217; that insisted on ignoring conscious experience itself, as well as any of its determinants that might be of direct or indirect genetic origin, took over academic departments of psychology. But Plotkin compellingly describes how 21st century psychology, which will be about consciousness as well as the brain, will probably incorporate findings from ethology, sociobiology, and evolutionary theory (including ideas about &#8216;selfish&#8217; genes)&#8230;a must-read.&#x22;David J. Murray, Queen&#8217;s University&#x22;This book is a true reflection of its title, a history of evolutionary thought within psychology, building on Darwin's original ambition to extend his theory to a science of the human mind. It runs through the eclipse of this thinking by behaviourism and its return in the last 20 years in the various forms of evolutionary psychology. A very readable introduction to the field.&#x22;Scientific and Medical Network Review, Summer 2005&#x22;Plotkin gives an erudite and engaging account of the intellectual currents that influenced the relationship between psychology and evolutionary thought over the past 100 years.....Interspersed throughout are interesting anecdotes, colorful descriptions of personalities, and accounts of twists of fate that affected careers and influenced the history of psychology....For any psychologist interested in the history of ideas -and how intellectual currents, politics and chance events can affect scientific paradigms-it is a must read. It's lasting value is that it provides a lucid and well-documented hisotry of the intellectually shameful exculsion of evolutionary thought in psychological theory during most of the 20th century. Thankfully, that exclusion is being remedied in the 21st century.&#x22;Personnel Psychology, Summer 2005`This is science writing of a high order, and I hope this book has the wide readership it so strongly merits.'Michael Ruse, Journal of the History of the Behavioural Sciences, Autumn 2005","categories":[["Books","Health, Fitness & Dieting","Psychology & Counseling","History"],["Books","Medical Books","Psychology","Cognitive"],["Books","Medical Books","Psychology","History"],["Books","Science & Math","Behavioral Sciences","Cognitive Psychology"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Health, Fitness & Dieting","Psychology & Counseling","History"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Professional Science","Behavioral Sciences","Cognitive Psychology"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Professional Science","Behavioral Sciences","Cognitive Science"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Science & Math","Behavioral Sciences","Cognitive Psychology"]],"genres":["Behavioral Sciences","Science & Math","Cognitive Science","History","Professional Science","Psychology","Professional & Technical","Medical Books","Psychology & Counseling","Cognitive","Cognitive Psychology","Health, Fitness & Dieting"]}

Continuing to stress the importance of communication between partners, Cox distinguishes her work with an impressive range of topics, as well as careful attention to the emotional and intellectual aspects of sex. With a friendly, funny, conversational tone, Cox provides the requisite sex tips as well as advice on increasing attractiveness, consolation for late bloomers and detailed instructions on becoming a better kisser (an oft-overlooked instructional). She also offers her take on controversial topics like interoffice dating (why not?), and disproves common wisdom such as the assumption that men have stronger sex drives than women; she also disproves the adage that there's nothing new under the sun with three new female spots, besides the G, ripe for stimulation. Most topics are addressed from both a male and female point of view, letting readers in on the other team's viewpoint; her only misstep is a chapter on homosexuality and bisexuality aimed more at curious heteros than practicing gays and lesbians. Otherwise, this solid sex resource holds plenty of answers, both to frequently asked questions and the ones you're afraid to ask.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now, Beattie rewards longtime fans and new readers alike with 11 deft, pitch-perfect stories. Plunging straight into the living rooms and back yards where her first-name-only protagonists gather to converse, complain, eat, drink and cook, Beattie gets to the evasive, impatient heart of 21st-century living. In clear, graceful prose, she presents a range of characters, from a penniless war veteran who must endure the &#x22;revenge of the ordinary world&#x22; (&#x22;Hurricane Carleyville&#x22;) to a culinary celebrity who vacations in Key West and anticipates preparing an impromptu meal for President Clinton (&#x22;The Big-Breasted Pilgrim&#x22;). In &#x22;The Famous Poet, Amid Bougainvillea,&#x22; Beattie's subtle, satiric wit comes to play as Hopper and Randy, assistants to rich artists, reminisce about the past and creak through the daily motions of living in bodies that have failed them. Similar themes of dependence and vulnerability arise in the emotionally charged &#x22;The Women of This World.&#x22; Adeptly depicting the dynamics between Dale; her ditzy mother-in-law, Brenda; her scholarly husband, Nelson; and her shrewdly malevolent father-in-law, Jerome, Beattie juxtaposes Nelson and Jerome's struggle for perfection in life, music and wine with a terrible tragedy that causes Dale to ruminate on humanity's inherent imperfection. Beattie still captures the zeitgeist like no one else, effortlesslyDor so it seemsDrevealing the sudden intimacies and sweet ironies of a crowded, improbable world. Only when she touches down, light as a trapeze artist, at the end of a tale, does the reader become aware of the perfect arcs she traces. (Jan.) Forecast: Beattie won the 2000 Pen/Malamud Award for excellence in short fiction.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963c0a"},"asin":"B000SEFBP2","description":"William Jackson Cassidy had escorted this particular reprobate before, and it never failed. The two of them walking down the street side by side drew every female eye for a half a mile.Heads turned. Slow, admiring smiles spread across faces of women young and old. A pretty, little curly-headed thing beamed at them from across the parking lot, and Romeo perked right up.&#x22;Don't even think about it,&#x22; Jax warned, giving a little tug on the line that held them together.More than one woman had commented that they resem-bled one another, although Jax just didn't see it.Oh, they both had hair that was a little longer and blonder than most. Jax's used to drag the top of his shoul-ders when it wasn't pulled back into a disreputable-look-ing ponytail that more than one woman had claimed made him look dangerous in a very interesting way. He now had what was, for him, a fairly short, neat trim, the ends barely brushing his collar in the back. Romeo, too, had gotten a trim, since spring was coming on strong already in north Georgia, even though it was only March. Both he and Romeo were full through the shoulders and lean in the hips, and Jax wouldn't deny that they both probably had a little swagger to their walk.But Jax wasn't nearly as conceited or as much of a flirt as Romeo, who was probably the most pathetic thing Jax had ever encountered. Jax chased criminals for a living. He'd seen &#x22;pathetic&#x22; before.Romeo was a police academy dropout and now, a kept man. Kept, unfortunately, by Jax's softhearted, dying mother, who was completely blind to every fault Romeo had.&#x22;She probably left you every dime she's got,&#x22; Jax com-plained, just imagining the way Romeo would strut then.For the moment, Romeo just kept on walking, oblivi-ous, as ever, to any insult Jax slung his way.The security guard at the hospital's employee entrance was an off-duty cop and a friend, who let them slip in the back way and up the stairs. Jax thanked the man and tried not to sound ungrateful for the patrol-man's offer of sympathy. He wasn't ungrateful, not really, just trying as hard as he could to deny what was kept wanting to talk about it.He knew they meant well, but it didn't help to know everyone else felt lousy about what was happening. He felt lousy, too. That bit about misery loving company just wasn't working for him. He thought he'd be better off if everyone in town would just let him wallow in his misery and pretended to be oblivious to the whole situation.But they all knew his mother, and they all loved her. Most of them either had known his father or had fathers who'd known his father, through the job. A good number of them had dated one or more of his sisters, and the rest&#151;the females&#151;had dated Jax himself.to help, but the hard truth was, his mother was dying.Nothing made that better, and he wasn't sure how much more he could stand, watching her suffer this way.They got to the third floor, and Jax held up a hand to signal Romeo to stop.&#x22;Remember, be quiet,&#x22; he warned as he eased open the door, which led directly onto the hospice ward. &#x22;All right. Coast is clear.&#x22;The three nurses at the nurses' station obligingly looked the other way, feigning a sudden and unfailing interest in a splotch of paint on the ceiling of the hall. They were sweethearts. All of them. Any other time, and he would have been as charming to them as humanly possible, giving them one of the legendary smiles for which the Cassidy men were known.He wasn't being conceited. His mother had told him all about the power of a Cassidy male's charm from the mo-ment of his birth and sworn he wouldn't be getting away with anything with her because of it. Supposedly he'd gur-gled and slobbered on her, waved his fists madly and smiled with every bit of the charm she feared a male child of Billy Cassidy's would have.As his grandma Cassidy had told the story, his mother had promptly started praying that God would send her nothing but female children from then on, and she'd gotten her wish. Three times. Then she'd proceeded to try as hard as she could to raise her only son to think the ability to charm women was something of a burden, dangerous, unpredictable and a completely unfair advantage to wage against the women of this world.It was the one thing she'd never convinced him of, de-spite the fact that they loved each other dearly.Jax slipped out the door and into the hall. Romeo perked up as he spotted the women at the desk.&#x22;You say a word to them, and you'll sleep outside for a week,&#x22; Jax threatened.He got nothing but a low growl in return.Romeo had never met a woman he didn't like. He saw a pretty one and everything else went straight out of his head.&#x22;Just remember where we are, and that you're not sup-posed to be here,&#x22; Jax reminded him.As hospitals went, this wasn't bad. It was in a nice, old, whitewashed stone building with a wide, elegant, wrap-around porch and tall, white columns, which used to be the main hospital seventy years ago. Now, the real hospital lay off to the right, attached to the hospice unit by a pretty atrium.They kept things quieter over here. It was dark and peaceful. The patients slept as long as they could in the morning and throughout the day, had as much medication as their systems could stand and as little pain as was humanly possible, although it was still too much.Jax hated the place.But his mother was in the room down the hall, and there was nothing on this earth that would keep him away from her now or at any other time in her life when she needed him.His three little sisters were all exhausted from the battle they'd fought to keep their mother at home, where she'd asked to stay until the end. But in the middle of the night, forty-eight hours ago, her breathing had gotten so labored and the pain so bad and his sisters had cried so many tears and hurt so badly themselves, that maybe he'd just gotten too scared to let it end like that. Because he'd called 911, and they'd carted his mother off here, where, with the kind of strength she'd always possessed and he'd never under-stood, she still clung stubbornly to life.She was one amazing woman. How could she do some-thing as ordinary as die?Pausing outside the door, he looked over to Romeo and shook his head in disgust. &#x22;Don't jump on her or hang all over her. She hurts just about everywhere,&#x22; Jax said, then thought of one more thing. &#x22;And don't you dare cry.&#x22;Jax pushed open the door. The room was dim. His pretty quilt stitched by his own grandma Jackson's hand, the woman whose family name he carried. William, for his Jackson, for his mother's family. William Jackson Cassidy.His mother had realized right away what a mouthful it was. She was the one who'd given him the nickname Jax when he was still tiny, when she'd been young and abso-lutely stunning, from the pictures he'd seen, and had what everyone must have thought was a long, happy life ahead of her. A husband she loved dearly, one who clearly adored her, a son who adored her just as much, and three beauti-ful daughters.&#x22;Didn't quite work out that way, did it, Mom?&#x22; he whispered.Her pretty, honey-colored hair was long gone, her eyes sunk down into her face, dark circles under them, no color at all in her cheeks. She turned her head ever so slowly to-ward him and managed a weak smile.Then she caught sight of Romeo and said, &#x22;Oh, baby. You made it.&#x22;Romeo stood there and grinned like a fool. His tail swished back and forth in a move that he seemed to think made women swoon. Of course, he thought everything he did made women swoon, and Jax couldn't deny it was pretty much true.The dog had a way with women.Especially Jax's mother. &#x22;Come here, sweet thing,&#x22; his mother said. &#x22;I take it you mean the dog, and not me?&#x22; Jax said, tak-ing the chair by her bedside and sitting down.&#x22;You know I love you,&#x22; she murmured weakly, turning her cheek for his kiss.He gave her one, trying to make it seem like any other greeting he'd given her over the years. Casual and easy, as if he had ages to say hello to her this way. As if this might not be the last time.How could that be?The last time?What were they going to do without her? &#x22;You love the dog more than any of us,&#x22; he said, because it was a familiar argument, and he couldn't stand to talk about her dying.&#x22;You're just jealous, because he's prettier than you, women like him better,&#x22; his mother said, actually managing to make him grin when he wouldn't have thought anything could. She was one of those who claimed he and the dog were way too much alike. Another subject he was happy to talk about, instead of what was going on here.Romeo whined and put his front paws up on the bed, then stuck his cold nose against his mother's cheek. She smiled and turned her face to him. &#x22;Come here, baby.&#x22;The dog leaped up onto the bed. &#x22;Romeo, what did I just tell you?&#x22; Jax reminded him. The dog gave him a look that he could swear said,She does love me more than you, and I am prettier than you. So there.&#x22;It's all right,&#x22; his mother said, the words coming slowly, her breathing labored. &#x22;, been at this for a long time. He knows, to be careful. Come right up here beside me, baby.&#x22;Her fifty-five-pound baby crept up very slowly, feeling his way, until he was as close to her as he could get, pressed against her side, all stretched out on the bed, his head on her right arm, his nose against her cheek. He whimpered softly.&#x22;Yes. That's my good boy.&#x22; His mother leaned her head against the dog's and gave a contented sigh, then turned back to Jax. &#x22;Thank you for bringing him.&#x22;&#x22;You know I'd do anything for you,&#x22; he said and worried he might be the one to start to cry.&#x22;Yes, I know.&#x22;&#x22;Sorry about bringing you here.&#x22;&#x22;It's fine, . Doesn't hurt much now. The medication is, They keep the really good stuff here. I needed it.&#x22;&#x22;If you want, we'll take you back home.&#x22; And somehow they'd find the strength to s...","price":{"$numberDouble":"2.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QCh4U-NHL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B009ERVHXO","B0083DNJWW","B007MFLK0A","B007MEVJAC","B007MB7FYO","B00FR0SODS","B00GP3N9O0","B004Z2I498","B006Y9YNEA","B00FQVMM6I","B00K5EZXTE","B00IGLOKR4","B00K3698M2","B005EHQB4I","B0085MNQNI","B00JJX4RWG","B000MAH9NE","B000QCTO36","B00I8VPYEA","B00ILWP2NO","B00KB5BUVM","B00K9XXA32","B00IYG08J0","B00GMWZH7G","B00IHCNQT0","B00HZCQAK0","B00FJ34XVA","B009XDDVME","B00DPABB64","B00GRAZD3G","B005XDQW9C","B00HEWWNL6","B00IWU47PE","B00I66BQBC","B00ISEI4H6","B00J2I0PZG","B00I8OS77S","B00HZ3QXRO","B0055POB5K","B004Z2I5ZQ","B00G2URB6I","B00FWYBQPM","B003XNTYXU","B00B00BASU","B00FPB6V9S","B008X4BPW2","B00AISB5QM","B00GPDYJ2Q","B00DGVFUJG","B00AM1ZB38","B00FX7LX0Q","B00ALTVIHO","B00835RNJU","B0089NUKS2","B006QADQ86","B00FRLRCMQ","B005XDR0BG","B008J2IS0K","B009YEVFQQ","B005WJDKA6","B00AYJHISE","B00AEVVJD2","B00C10DHVG","B0055OU0CY","B00GPDYJ0S","B00DD0VE90","B00AMS2V8E","B009A2E168","B008YA0A30","B00BL6BROU","B008X47FJ4","B00B28BR6U","B008IU9SSE","B00CP6NH7A","B00ALTVHJI","B00357PU3C","B009QX0O3K","B0091TMCE8","B007UNC1NO","B004GEARNQ","B004GEARMC","B004QWZDZK","B00B1CFAOM","B001OFICKK","B004ISLNVK","B005HRT6L0","B00AA3P7M8","B008X47FJY","B009NEIVBO","B004XDWULW","B0092XHP4K","B008EO70XY","B00AN7524Y","B00BED26Q8","B005XDR53E","B008O53ROE","B004MPRZAW","B004I1L1LY","B008MBWV06"],"buy_after_viewing":["B0083DNJWW","B009ERVHXO","B007MFLK0A","B00GP3N9O0"]},"categories":[["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Literature & Fiction","Romance"],["Books","Literature & Fiction","Women's Fiction","Domestic Life"],["Books","Religion & Spirituality","Fiction","Romance"],["Books","Romance"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Religious & Inspirational Fiction","Romance"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Fiction","Romance"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Romance","Series","Steeple Hill Women's Fiction"]],"genres":["Series","Christian Books & Bibles","Domestic Life","Romance","Religious & Inspirational Fiction","Religion & Spirituality","Women's Fiction","Literature & Fiction","Fiction","Steeple Hill Women's Fiction","Christian Fiction"]}

Nature&#x2019;s extravagant diversity, unfolding in living color, has made you long to know the artist who dreamed it all up. Imagine what that might be like&#x2014;to actually know God in a way that fills your heart and whispers tremendous value and purpose to something deep within you.But how can you experience a being you&#x2019;re not even sure exists? Religious jargon and games can&#x2019;t satisfy such a longing. It&#x2019;s got to be real &#x2026; or nothing at all.A Search for What Is Real helps you sort through the questions, objections, and concerns that arise when you consider God not as some theological abstraction, but as someone you can actually connect with &#x2026; and want to connect with, perhaps more than you know.FINDING FAITHThe Finding Faith books A Search for What Makes Sense and A Search for What Is Real don&#x2019;t try to tell you what to believe; they are guides in learning how to believe. If you think the spiritual journey requires turning your back on honesty and intellectual integrity, these two companion volumes will speak to both your mind and your soul.","price":{"$numberDouble":"5.98"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517QK2-ws1L._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B000SEGCPA","B004J17FRC","B0035D9UVO","B000MAHCKO","B0012E3JBA","B0017T0CN8","B00DB39V2Q","B000SEOW48","B00FPQCSJU","B00FJ3773Q","B007BGQ9OW","B008EOLF9E","B0040ZNZOO","B007FZOXOM","B0089LOKUS","B007Q77XV4","B002BD2UR0","B004HD62K8","B00DB2YPDW","B00C10MMZ8","B004IWR3LA","B0010SEM7I","B005NWRI50","B007IWW7LS","B001NLKXU2","B009QYVGJA","B005O078OM","B007MAXH2E","B003ZYETP0","B008AVNFQM","B004IWR3CE","B000PDZFUW","B00CD36FUQ","B00F1W0RD2","B001UFMUDY","B0078XFHT6","B007TKLG02","B002AKPFYO","B007US9NDU","B0052DYEUW"],"buy_after_viewing":["B000SEGCPA","B0035D9UVO","B008EOLF9E","B0017T0CN8"]},"categories":[["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Living","Faith"],["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Living","Spiritual Growth"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Living","Faith"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Living","Spiritual Growth"]],"genres":["Christian Books & Bibles","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Living","Spiritual Growth","Faith"]}

Thus he provides readers with a series of essays or character sketches in which he plays a supporting role. Some of the players in the first of three sections, &#x22;Vermont Boyhood,&#x22; will ring bells with fans of Peck's &#x22;Soup&#x22; stories (Random). In &#x22;Early Manhood,&#x22; he looks into his time in the army and his work experiences, including stints in a paper mill and in advertising. &#x22;Florida Years&#x22; features interesting personalities&ndash;an old man living in a shack in the woods with his dog, a waitress at a small diner, Jamaicans in the sugar-cane fields of Florida. These are folks to whom life has often been less than generous, but Peck has found in them wisdom, tenacity, and tenderness. The final chapter, &#x22;Just As I Am,&#x22; is a compilation of Peck's words to live by. There is humor, as one might expect, and a good deal of near-heartbreaking pain, along with a dollop of hokum here and there. Because Peck has not written of his life as a writer, these essays are as likely to appeal to readers who have never heard of him. Perhaps they are more likely to appeal to adults than to teen readers who may not yet have lived long enough to see the strength required to live an &#x22;ordinary life.&#x22;&ndash;Coop Renner, Hillside Elementary, El Paso, TXCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Eddy, a 16-year-old Japanese American, tells how he and his buddies, Chik and Cobra, become part of Company B of the 100th Infantry Battalion following the attack on Pearl Harbor. Without discounting the community's old loyalties to Japan, the story makes clear the transition caused by the declaration of war, and by the desire to be part of the great fight to protect America. These young men are patriotic, but the powers that be have a hard time trusting their dedication. The novel is based on historical fact, and Salisbury brings events vividly to life as he recounts one humiliation after another foisted on the troops, from the top down to their immediate commanders. In one scene, these soldiers are heading to training camps on trains that pass internment camps for other Japanese Americans. As the actual assignment unfolds&ndash;they are to act as bait in the training of attack dogs&ndash;the pernicious racism and absurd beliefs are further revealed. The immediacy of the writing allows readers to imagine themselves as one of the boys. A story with huge implications for observers of current events.&ndash;Carol A.

The authors offer a host of indispensable lessons for citizens and policymakers in diverse domains, including education, pollution, national security, and health care. At the same time, Full Disclosure is an important contribution to democratic theory -- and a great read to boot.&#x22;Cass Sunstein, University of Chicago Law School&#x22;Sunshine may indeed be the best disinfectant, in Louis Brandeis' words, but only if we know when, where, and how to shine the light. That is exactly the task that Full Disclosure sets itself. This is an important book at an important time, for everyone from mayors to senators to secretary generals.&#x22;Anne-Marie Slaughter, Dean, Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University&#x22;The authors have done us all a good service by offering sound analysis and ideas on how to make public policy transparent and accessible for all citizens.  As the country heads into the 21st century, more transparent governance is just what we need.&#x22;Tom Daschle, Former Senate Majority Leader&#x22;Governmental transparency efforts inform the public about additives in the food we eat, dangerous criminals in our neighborhoods, and the financial support of our political leaders. Full Disclosure offers several important lessons that will help give citizens easier access to vital information through the creation of better, more meaningful transparency policies.&#x22;Bill Richardson, Governor of New Mexico&#x22;Superb...This rich, carefully researched, well balanced, and readily accessible study shows us that good governance, with legislators at the local, state, or national levels in the lead, is surely difficult but far from unattainable.  This is hard-nosed scholarship demonstrating, as the authors themselves discovered, that pragmatism about both  policy expectations and policy results should prevail among political leaders and citizens alike.&#x22;Brian J. Cook, Clark University, Perspectives on Politics&#x22;Full Disclosure provides a wide-ranging and systematic analysis of targeted transparency in the United States...The book makes two key contributions: it clarifies the factors that determines whether policies are effective and it suggests that transparency measures are now entering a new phase when they can be even more useful to the public than in the past.&#x22;Paul Starr, The American Prospect&#x22;It is a fantastically researched and excellently written....I suspect it is destined to become the definitive book in the area, and i recommend it to academics...&#x22;Jay P. Shimshack, Political Science Quarterly&#x22;A major contribution to our understanding of targeted transparency as a policy...Fung, Graham and Weil have provided a compendium and reference resource for thinking about how to structure transparency in the new governance...&#x22;Lisa Blomgren Bingham, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management&#x22;Full Disclosure is a guide for policymakers, complete with the requisite &#x22;10 principles for an effective transparency policy&#x22; guide. It ought to make citizens wise to the tricks that commonly turn transparency policies into little more than symbolism.&#x22;Lee Drutman,  San Francisco Chronicle&#x22;In their thoughtful and constructive book, Full Disclosure: The Perils and Promise of Transparency, Archon Fung, Mary Graham, and David Weil provide an in-depth assessment of government mandated disclosure policies intended to reduce the costs to consumers created by imperfect information.&#x22;Clifford Winston, Brookings Institution, Journal of Economic Literature","price":{"$numberDouble":"5.29"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ABok2ctEL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B0039OVIAU","B00A5DCALY","B00BURLV3W","B008DVPCLA","B007U69DKU","B0053PY3EQ","B001HBI2WO","B009N08NKW","B008EKMC9K","B00EGJB08W","B006VE7YS0","B005VSRFEA","B004CR6ALA","B00ADMQZRC"],"buy_after_viewing":["B0039OVIAU","B00D64QS1W","B003DQP8BY"]},"categories":[["Books","Business & Money","Economics"],["Books","Politics & Social Sciences","Politics & Government","Political Science"],["Books","Politics & Social Sciences","Politics & Government","Public Affairs & Policy"],["Books","Politics & Social Sciences","Politics & Government","United States"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Politics & Social Sciences","Politics & Government","Political Science"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Politics & Social Sciences","Politics & Government","Public Affairs & Policy","Public Policy"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Politics & Social Sciences","Politics & Government","United States","Federal Government"]],"genres":["Politics & Social Sciences","Politics & Government","Federal Government","Economics","Business & Money","Public Policy","Political Science","United States","Public Affairs & Policy"]}

One July day, they decide to surprise their busy parents by preparing dinner. They find a recipe for chicken piccata with capers on the Internet and shop for the ingredients, picking up a package of long grain and wild rice, and the makings for salad as well. The meal is a success, and Dad surprises them with cooking lessons at a local kitchenware shop. The girls also visit their grandfather at the Jersey shore, help Mom cook for neighbors who had a fire in their home, baby-sit, deal with a difficult peer, and talk about boys. The protagonists seem rather sophisticated and have more freedom without adult supervision than most kids their age. Three recipes are included, as well as a list of cooking tips.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963c3c"},"asin":"B000SEP71A","description":"Grade 3-5?The prolific writer of juvenile sports fiction takes a crack at nonfiction. He describes nine dramatic moments from baseball's historical past, featuring the likes of Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Reggie Jackson, and Jim Abbott. These accounts depict the courageous aspects as well as the spectacular, including Dave Dravecky's comeback after cancer surgery, and the hobbled Kirk Gibson's game-winning home run in the 1988 World Series. Christopher tends to drift to his fictional roots as a number of the stories are laced with manufactured feelings, thoughts, and quotes. He also tends to generalize: &#x22;As the crowd in Fenway Park watched Ted Williams run off the field for the last time, they told each other, 'There goes the greatest hitter that ever lived.' &#x22; While his portrayals of these moments are basically accurate, the sidelights he adds without documentation have him walking a fine line between fact and fiction. While Christopher's legions of young fans will enjoy the book, a more straightforward account of memorable events in America's pastime can be found in Geoffrey Ward's 25 Great Moments in Baseball (Knopf, 1994), which is based on Ken Burns's public-television series, Baseball, the American Epic.?Tom S.

She argues that the impulse toward maintaining a cleanly outward appearance, which plays a central role in sexual attraction, is opposed by a psychological or religious desire for inner purity linked to Christian asceticism, which disdained physical adornment. Thanks to the development of an ethos of sanitary need in the Victorian era, which linked cleanliness to purity, personal hygiene has now reached the stage of general consensus, with newly emerging middle classes around the world eager to buy hygienic and cosmetic products to meet Western standards of appearance. Smith's chronicle is sprinkled with interesting details and draws on a broad cultural canvas, but the tone is academic; general readers will prefer to await a more popular history. 25 illus.(July)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Christopher systematically describes Jordan's career, starting in high school and following through his college, Olympic, and professional days (with the stop off at baseball). The book ends with the Bulls' loss to Orlando in the 1995 season playoffs. Those familiar with the athlete's career will probably already know some of the anecdotes covered in this book. For example, there's the oft-repeated fact that Jordan didn't make the varsity basketball squad in his sophomore year in high school, and his trials as a minor league baseball player are common knowledge. Yet, many fans will find this clearly written title among the most satisfying of all of the Jordan biographies. Although the author mentions controversies involving his subject's gambling and the tragedy of his father's murder, he recognizes that what many sports fans want is the highlights of players' careers and meaty descriptions of their key games.

The resulting endeavor, described in alternating chapters by Mr. Collins and four of the students, builds more than geometry as readers come to see them as individuals and as a developing unit. They include artistic tough guy James Harris III, who insists that the individual tetrahedrons color coordinate; Marcel the Magnificent, who works vigorously at his fathers barbecue grill; veteran foster child Sharice; and quietly ambitious Rhondell. Marcels dads recipes are sprinkled throughout. This novel is based on the true story of a Cleveland middle school tetrahedron built in 2002. Pearsall has a knack for creating strong narratives and characters that eschew predictability. While this solid, multivoiced offering is a hopeful one, the action is realistically gritty and true to its inner-city setting. The book may take a little hand-selling, but, like E. L.

But those styles were developed from earlier traditions, as detailed by Stalley (history of art, Trinity Coll., Dublin). Covering the period 313-1200 C.E., Stalley discusses the influence of early Christianity prior to the emergence of the Gothic style. He examines stylistic periods as well as the elements of engineering and construction, the cooperative efforts of builder and patron, and the broad categories of secular and church structures. Photographs of buildings, diagrams, and period art tie in well with the text. Though the focus is specialized, Stalley's book is inviting to both students and general readers.

This book, in dealing with a wide range of issues relating to cults and religious movements in general, complements the other books in the series, all of which focus on specific religious groups. -- Why this series? This is an age when countless groups and movements, old and new, mark the religious landscape in our culture, leaving many people confused or uncertain in their search for spiritual truth and meaning. Because few people have the time or opportunity to research these movements fully, these books provide essential information and insights for their spiritual journeys. Except for this book, each book in the series has five sections: - A concise introduction to the group - An overview of the group's theology -- in its own words - Tips for witnessing effectively to members of the group - A bibliography with sources for further study - A comparison chart that shows the essential differences between biblical Christianity and the group -- The writers of these volumes are well qualified to present clear and reliable information and help us discern religious truth from falsehood.","genres":["Two hours or more (65-100 pages)","Apologetics","Christian Books & Bibles","Kindle Short Reads","Theology","Religion & Spirituality","Comparative Religion","Religious Studies & Reference","Religious Studies"]}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963c4d"},"asin":"B000SF8504","description":"Grade 5-7-Narrator Ramon de Ocampo does a fine job bringing to life this lively celebration of skateboarding superstar Tony Hawk and his misunderstood sport. Credited to the late Matt Christopher but written by Glenn Stout, On the Halfpipe-with Tony Hawk shows how Hawk changed the history of skateboarding. The narrator's clear, understated delivery serves the text well. He doesn't try to sound too &#x22;hip,&#x22; and reads the story with respect and even a certain degree of awe. This approach works especially well in the book's final chapter, a thrilling recap of Hawk's attempts to master a near-impossible move called the 900. Thanks to some exciting writing in this section, de Ocampo helps listeners experience what it must feel like to try this mid-air maneuver. Nothing else in the book matches this passage, but what remains entertains. The first two chapters explore the evolution of skateboarding from a fad that borrowed elements of surfing and rollerskating to the successful industry that it is today. Hawk was not interviewed for this book; the author relies on outside sources to paint a portrait of the skateboarding champ. Listeners learn about Hawk's childhood and his introduction to the sport. Although the book is mostly upbeat, chronicling Hawk's many successes, it doesn't shy away from some of his personal hardships (losing his father, getting a divorce, falling out of favor with the younger skateboarding crowd). Ultimately though, it shows the star landing on his feet and emerging as a successful role model who shatters the stereotype that skateboarders are socially irresponsible misfits. Young skateboarding enthusiasts will enjoy this title.Brian E.

It gives undergraduate or community college students vital information about learning. The four-step process entices students to think critically and develop strategies for meaningful learning experiences. This idea makes this text truly unique. It is filled with journals and student reflections, engaging and meaningful activities, and a dynamic appendix summarizing the self-management method.  I am excited to come into contact with an academic text that does not demean the integrity of the student with gimmicks and tricks, but engages him or her with meaningful strategies geared to facilitate knowledge acquisition, retention, and retrieval.

To stagger together through today's column about grammatical possessiveness, you and I must agree on the difference between a gerund and a participle.Take the worddancing. It starts out as a form of a verb: &#x22;Look, Ma, I'mdancing!&#x22; When that word is used as an adjective to modify a noun -- &#x22;look at that dancing bear!&#x22; -- it's called a participle.But when the same word is used as a noun -- &#x22;I see the bear, and itsdancingisn't so hot&#x22; -- then the word is classified as a gerund. (From the Latingerundum, rooted ingerere, &#x22;to bear, to carry,&#x22; because the gerund, though a noun, seems to bear the action of a verb.)We give the same word these different names to tell us what it's doing and what its grammatical needs are. Two great grammarians had a titanic spat in the 1920s over the use of the possessive in this sentence: &#x22;Women having the vote reduces men's political power.&#x22; H. W. Fowler derided what he called &#x22;the fused participle&#x22; as &#x22;grammatically indefensible&#x22; and said it should be &#x22;Women's having&#x22;; Otto Jespersen cited famous usages, urged dropping the possessive and called Fowler a &#x22;grammatical moralizer.&#x22;Comes now Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia with the latest manifestation of this struggle. An Associated Press account of his stinging dissent inLawrence v. Texas,in which the Court struck down that state's anti-sodomy law, quoted Scalia out of context as writing, &#x22;I have nothing against homosexuals,&#x22; which seemed condescending. His entire sentence, though, was not: &#x22;I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means.&#x22;Note the lack of apostrophes afterhomosexualsandgroupto indicate possession; Fowler would have condemned that as a &#x22;fused participle.&#x22; Such loosey-goosey usage from the conservative Scalia, of all people?&#x22;When I composed the passage in question,&#x22; the justice informs me, &#x22;I pondered for some time whether I should be perfectly grammatical and write 'I have nothing against homosexuals', or any other group's, promoting their agenda,' etc. The object of the preposition 'against,' after all, is not 'homosexualswho arepromoting,' but rather 'the promotingof(in the sense ofby) homosexuals.'&#x22;I have tried to be rigorously consistent in using the possessive before the participle,&#x22; Scalia notes, &#x22;when it is the action, rather than the actor, that is the object of the verb or preposition (or, for that matter, the subject of the sentence).&#x22;But what about his passage inLawrence, in which he failed to follow Fowler and fused the participle?&#x22;I concluded that because of the intervening phrase 'or any other group,' writing 'homosexuals' &#x22; -- with the apostrophe indicating possession -- &#x22;(and hence 'any other group's') would violate what is perhaps the first rule of English usage: that no construction should call attention to its own grammatical correctness. Finding no other formulation that could make the point in quite the way I wanted, I decided to be ungrammatical instead of pedantic.&#x22;But his attempt to be a regular guy backfired. In a jocular tone, Scalia observes: &#x22;God -- whom I believe to be a strict grammarian as well as an Englishman -- has punished me. The misquotation would have been more difficult to engineer had there been an apostrophe after 'homosexuals.' I am convinced that in this instance the AP has been (unwittingly, I am sure) theflagellum Deito recall me from my populist, illiterate wandering. (You will note that I did not say 'from me wandering.')&#x22;Mydoes beatmebefore that gerundwandering. Robert Burchfield, editor of the third edition ofFowler's Modern English Usage,writes, &#x22;The possessive with gerund is on the retreat, but its use with proper names and personal nouns and pronouns persists in good writing.&#x22;Now let's parse Scalia's self-parsing. In his refusal to say &#x22;from me wandering,&#x22;wanderingis a gerund. When a personal pronoun comes in front of a gerund, the possessive form is called for: saymy, notme. This avoidance of a fused participle makes sense: you say about the above-mentioned bear &#x22;I likehisdancing,&#x22; not &#x22;I likehimdancing,&#x22; because you want to stress not the bear but his action in prancing about.In Scalia's dissent in the Texas sodomy case,promotingis a gerund, the object of the prepositionagainst. His strict-construction alternative, using apostrophes to indicate possession -- &#x22;against homosexuals', or any other group's, promoting&#x22; -- is correct but clunky. He was right to avoid it, and is wrong to castigate himself for eschewing clunkiness.There would have been another choice, however: put the gerund ahead of the possessors. Try this: &#x22;I have nothing against the promoting of their agenda by homosexuals, or by any other group, through normal democratic means.&#x22; That would not only avoid the confusing apostrophes, but follows &#x22;I have nothing against&#x22; with its true object, the gerundpromoting-- and would make it impossible for any reporter to pull out a condescending &#x22;I have nothing against homosexuals.&#x22;Regarding your proposed solution to my gerundial problem (to wit, &#x22;I have nothing against the promoting of their agenda by homosexuals, or by any other group, through normal democratic means&#x22;): It is so obvious that of course I considered it. Two problems. (1) I do not like to have a relative pronoun preceding its antecedent, as in &#x22;the promoting oftheiragenda by homosexuals.&#x22; (2) More importantly, English remains a language in which emphasis is largely conveyed by word order, and the emphasis in my sentence was uponhomosexuals'promoting, not upon (where your alternative places it) thepromotingby homosexuals. Surely you can sense the difference.Justice Antonin ScaliaSupreme Court of the United StatesWashington, D.C.Copyright &#169; 2004 by The Cobbett Corporation","genres":["Humor","Humor & Entertainment","Politics & Social Sciences","Vocabulary, Slang & Word Lists","Linguistics","Communication & Media Studies","Words, Language & Grammar","Reference","Social Sciences","Academic & Commercial","Vocabulary","Writing, Research & Publishing Guides","Communication"]}

In retaliation, American President Condoleezza Rice has, through the magic of an unimagined technology, shut down all of Mexico's telephone, fax and Internet communications. That's the fanciful but not entirely implausible futuristic backdrop for this corrosive political satire from Fuentes (The Old Gringo), considered Mexico's leading novelist (and one-time ambassador to France). His darkly comic tale of backbiting, double-crossing, murderous duplicity, sexual scheming and outright assassination is primarily epistolary, and it's a format that suits Fuentes's flowery prose style, though the voices of his various characters tend to blur into one another. Readers with even a smidgeon of familiarity with Mexico's unkempt political traditions will wallow in this caustic indictment.(May 16)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His friend Sara Wilson, sports reporter for the school newspaper, gives lots of press to the team and especially to Koby, hoping to increase student support. The publicity and a winning streak soon result in full stands at all of the games. Then a local TV newsman decides to do a documentary on middle-school athletics with Monticello and Koby as its focus. When the attention goes to his head, Koby forgets all about teamwork, loses a game, almost loses his friends, and nearly blows the conference championship. This fast-paced, easy-to-read story has plenty of baseball action. Excerpts of sports articles from the school paper, including trivia questions about real-life major league players, add a great deal of interest and the book's message is driven home successfully.

In Seven Seasons of the Man in the Mirror, Morley shifts the focus to wide-angle. Looking at the broad sweep of life itself, he helps men determine where they are, where they&#x92;re headed, and how to get there.Drawing on the lessons of his own life and wisdom from the Bible, Morley presents hard-won perspectives on the seven seasons of Reflection, Building, Crisis, Renewal, Rebuilding, Suffering, and Success--and in so doing, addresses men&#x92;s deep longing for direction and purpose. With candor and passion, he speaks to issues every man must face. He illustrates them with true, modern-life stories. And he presents meaty questions for men to chew on and decisions for them to act on. This penetrating, richly encouraging book will help men turn from empty pursuits to the joy, passion, and eternal satisfaction of manhood&#x92;s highest purpose.","price":{"$numberDouble":"9.95"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B9cXN2L1L._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B0054K8I4Q","B004M18F5A","B004Y89QWC","B00CQZ6F60","B004B8W0EG","B007FZOWIE","B001GBZ3GI","B00JJPZUZM","B003LSTJWS","B005MTBIYQ","B008E6OH42","B004HO5J92","B007X93V4S","B005MZIDIY","B0043M58YO","B0071I65D0","B008QLXPAW","B005QPIA4M","B006NZ6744","B0047O2B70","B007V699MQ","B00A68WKFO"],"buy_after_viewing":["B0054K8I4Q","B004M18F5A","B00CQZ6F60"]},"categories":[["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Living","Men's Issues"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Living","Men's Christian Living"]],"genres":["Christian Books & Bibles","Men's Christian Living","Men's Issues","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Living"]}

This entertaining biography describes that season in detail, and includes a brief history of baseball in Japan from the 1870s to the present.

In this illuminating bio, University of Limerick professor Lodge (Politics in South Africa) shows how Mandela's struggle for equality brought him to prominence. Though Mandela is hardly lacking biographers, Lodge makes an important contribution with his argument that Mandela's appeal rests on his ability to personify his political beliefs. Mandela's politics, which emphasize a mix of authority, empathy and respect for all people, are mirrored by his actions and behavior toward everyone he's come in contact with, thereby allowing his personal grace and dignity to be a political gesture. According to Lodge, Mandela's magnanimity serves as a model for a new kind of citizenship, one that embraces difference and the messiness of democracy without sacrificing the gentlemanly restraint Mandela associated with English political institutions. Lodge is careful to give Mandela an assertive role in this process, showing how he cultivated his own life story and his status as a martyr for justice in order to hasten the coming of democracy to his country. Vivid descriptions of the daily horrors of apartheid and the men and women around Mandela, such as his ex-wife Winnie and the troubled F.W. de Klerk, reveal the complicated world that Mandela ultimately and triumphantly managed to change. 17 b&amp;w photos not seen byPW.(Sept. 30)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After Sandy Comstock goes to juvenile court for some minor offenses, his understanding probation officer lines him up for community-service work as an assistant coach for a Police Athletic League team. This is just the ticket for Sandy, who loves baseball and believes himself to be an excellent center fielder. However, he is humiliated when news of his crime reaches his teammates. Fortunately, his family is moving to a new town and he has a chance to start again. Unfortunately, Sandy is so preoccupied with the fear that his new teammates will discover his secret that he fails to make friends. It's only after he learns to relax and be honest that he's accepted by his team, and his skills on the field can be appreciated. Despite the obvious message, this novel is not so heavy-handed that it gets in the way of the story. The action moves along at a good clip with plenty of stuff about baseball to balance out the accounts of Sandy's inner turmoil. The writing is always clear and the descriptions are accurate. This is a good, serviceable story for kids who enjoy sports fiction.?Todd Morning, Schaumburg Township Public Library, ILCopyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.","price":{"$numberDouble":"4.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5179KHXl1pL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B004VWXUHI","B00ADUGDL2","B004CFA9KU","B0089LOJO0","B00GSZHYM8","B00DB32TG6","B002ZDJZMO","B002ZDJZOC","B0047Y0AX2","B000SG1DBQ","B000SFQ100","B002ZDJZLU","B000SF8N9C","B0035IIDBW","B0034DGP0Y","B002ZDK0L4","B002ZDK0PA","B002ZDJZK6","B002ZDJZTM","B00CKURWEA","B008TUQNDQ","B00A2E0JI2","B002ZDJZPQ","B002ZDK03M","B000SK3ZW2","B0035IIBUU","B00GG0GIX6","B002ZDJZVK","B002ZDK0NW","B002ZDJZWO","B000SGX382","B00DTUHIAS","B002ZDK050","B002ZDK0P0","B0078X1FH4","B004P8K3O6","B002ZDK0LE","B002ZDJZL0","B00578CR2E","B002ZDK0MS","B002ZDK000","B002ZDJZR4","B000SK1K60","B000SIT974","B0016H97GY","B00ESIVZT0","B000SM85EI","B00C13OVCC","B00BATIN7W","B005O08IZA","B002ZDJZNI","B000SFJ1BQ","B00BPDR3GK","B0037VD12I","B003AYZB9S","B002IPZK2S","B00FMIBMKM","B004PYDNFG","B002ZDJZMY","B000SES3IE","B001VA1PN4","B00B9FWZSK","B00H1294VG","B00AMQ6U0G","B002ZDK0QE","B0017LGURI","B000WJOU8W","B000SHVX06","B000SH2OJ0","B007WUSZTY","B003KK5DS6","B002ZDK0M8","B003TLN7RA","B001MYJ3E2","B002ZDK0QY","B000SKKVY2","B002EBDPD2","B00C2YXE00","B009EGEVQ0","B000OYEYW2","B000SIZ3MO","B002ZDJZW4","B002ZDJZS8","B009LLJPEG","B002ZDK04Q","B002ZDJZYM","B004IATC1G","B002ZDK03W","B0074VTHFM","B009R5H098","B0038B99LO","B000SH6E9G","B0080K3C1G","B00CX1USLU","B000SK3OT6","B00CYA08JM","B004FGMPKS","B002ZDK02I","B00FJ302EC","B000SIWQZQ"],"buy_after_viewing":["B002ZDJZTM","B002ZDK0L4","B002ZDJZMO","B002ZDJZOC"]},"categories":[["Books","Teen & Young Adult","Sports & Hobbies","Fiction"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Teen & Young Adult","Literature & Fiction","Sports"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Teen & Young Adult","Mysteries & Thrillers"]],"genres":["Mysteries & Thrillers","Sports & Hobbies","Sports","Fiction","Literature & Fiction","Teen & Young Adult"]}

The most memorable characters are taxi drivers, such as the Syracuse, N.Y., cabbie whose conversation gives the book its title: driving her to the airport before dawn, he warns Nye that he will ask three times if she is okay, Just to make sure you feel safe and secure. We're living in strange times, and I want you to feel very comfortable. In other highlights of Nye's tour, she re-creates the voices of a rickshaw driver in India who tries to talk her into visiting a rug store instead of the Taj Mahal; the Glasgow driver who invites her to sit in front with him and bids her farewell with, Okay then, be safe to the other side of the sea; and an Egyptian driver in New York City who boasts of trafficking in counterfeit handbags. Nye muses on what she learns on specific travels and shares stories about driving other people (among them, possibly senile strangers, distinguished visiting writers and her own son). Aside from some name-dropping and some mildly self-indulgent moments, Nye's prose flows fluidly and evokes any number of different settings. She makes her case that what happen[s] in the margins, on the way to the destinations of any day, might be as intriguing as what happen[s] when you {get] there. All ages.

We marvel at these 'flawless saints' while thinking, 'Wow! I'm not worthy!' Hey, not so fast. Believe it or not, the most celebrated people in the Bible were plagued by doubt, bad decisions, and less than perfect reputations. In a word, most were losers! And yet, God had plans that would take them beyond their humble, imperfect lives and dub them proud members of the 'losers' club. Losers Club is a real-life look at famous Bible figures such as Moses, Solomon, David, Thomas, Rahab, and others. Each vignette reveals people who struggle with weak faith, confusion, and frustration---people very much like you and me! These stories will help you connect with these flawed heroes, find encouragement in their stories, and get inspired by God's love and care for 'losers.'","price":{"$numberDouble":"14.95"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tiQm%2BqYJL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_viewed":["B00I2YDB6G","B000W4RFHK","B005ENBB1U","B00K8F7WOE","B00CWQHDBE","B005E1OVIC","B00JV4FD94","B00I2YDB7K","B00IRW4NVK","B005EI836G","B003TSEEDY"],"buy_after_viewing":["B00I2YDB6G","B000W4RFHK","B003TSEEDY"]},"categories":[["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Bible Study & Reference","Bible Study"],["Books","Religion & Spirituality"],["Books","Teen & Young Adult","Education & Reference","Social Science"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Bible Study & Reference","Bible Study"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Teen & Young Adult","Biography"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Teen & Young Adult","Religion & Spirituality"]],"genres":["Christian Books & Bibles","Social Science","Bible Study & Reference","Biography","Religion & Spirituality","Education & Reference","Teen & Young Adult","Bible Study"]}

The Love Chapter of the Bible paints a perfect picture of love. It reveals the ideal love for which everyone yearns. But the passage is not a fantasy of what might be nice. It is a serious essay on how love can be lived, describing qualities ordinary people can cultivate to build extraordinary relationships.Relationship experts Drs. Les and Leslie Parrott have compiled fifteen translations of 1 Corinthians 13 to inspire and teach anyone wanting to be a better lover. In the preface, the Parrotts describe love as the supreme good, a gift that lifts us outside of ourselves. They follow with meditations on very diverse translations and creative paraphrases of 1 Corinthians 13&#x97;from the 20th Century New Testament translation published in 1900 to The Message, published in 1995, from J. B. Phillips (1947) to The Living Bible (1979), and from the Basic Bible (1950) to the New King James Version (1979).This book makes a beautiful gift for engagements, weddings, Valentine&#x92;s Day, anniversaries, or any occasion when love is celebrated --Publisher","price":{"$numberDouble":"9.39"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41n23pqSdxL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B003QHZGNA","B0084WTEBW","B00INCUN2M","B00C9QGYNA","B000W914D6","B008745AWO","B00HDHUTZ4","B00EN16I3A","B00AQ0AMQ6","B007FZXEI8","B00HS4QBXQ","B00D7U4RJ0","B005OBXN54","B00JH4J9HU","B005MT8Q28","B000FC14EO","B0013TX9VY","B00AQ0ADLA","B007V93MLC","B009YM8EVM","B008R9VNBQ","B00JDNZXAW","B006J9DFKS","B003TWOK8Y","B007V8Z2WK","B00JJPZUZM","B00HDHUU12","B007V91I7W","B0058EFTEU","B00K3SRHKA","B006IEFTV2","B00H4JSZ4I","B0071B726Q","B00FWRLWI0","B0082J7SI8","B000SES0EG","B007V8Z49Q","B005ZTZSN0","B00B85M2NY","B003E8AIP2","B008DXFH5Y","B003TFE1Z8","B004T4KRJM","B006X50SLM","B006VWR4QO","B00A7KRKHO","B004HFS2N6","B005MTBJKE","B00A0VP75M","B000JMKT00","B00B853NY6","B005FHMUZQ","B003X2728K","B0091W3ET2","B008MPCVBQ","B006X4QONO","B0099EEZ18","B00B85M2PC","B0037YLBNQ","B00B8565UK","B00HMR4ORY","B000SELE7Q","B009068HI2","B007X3FY0S","B00DWTB3DY","B0073UPT10","B0010SIPOY","B005QR9U30","B0054QMFWQ","B005S9KSE6","B008EGV68M","B007WU6JW4","B00B85A7WC","B005GMYA80","B007JK5EW8","B005N045L2","B004GEATCK"],"buy_after_viewing":["B00HDHUTZ4","B00C9QGYNA","B003QHZGNA","B002PBB1CI"]},"categories":[["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Living","Marriage"],["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Living","Personal Growth"],["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Worship & Devotion","Meditations"],["Books","Religion & Spirituality","Spirituality","Devotionals"],["Books","Self-Help","Relationships","Marriage"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Health, Fitness & Dieting","Relationships","Marriage"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Living","Personal Growth"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Spirituality","Devotionals"]],"genres":["Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Meditations","Relationships","Health, Fitness & Dieting","Personal Growth","Christian Living","Religion & Spirituality","Marriage","Worship & Devotion","Devotionals","Self-Help"]}

The couple encounter many obstacles to their young love-parental resistance, class and age differences-but their ability to overcome such difficulties and to fashion a strong and lasting love is expressed in the pattern of the quilt that Johanna begins sewing just after their marriage.

When Jackie's dad finds love two years later with Bradleyville's prodigal daughter-the svelte, dressed-to-the-nines Katherine May King-Jackie rather predictably opposes their romance. But love is waiting in the wings for her, as well. Teen idol Greg Kostakis, lead singer of the boy band &#x22;LuvRush,&#x22; is distantly related to Katherine, and not too many pages elapse before Jackie and Greg are infatuated with each other, despite his busy concert schedule. As Jackie explores the complications of romance, she cultivates empathy for her father and Katherine as they come to grips with demons from their pasts. The slangy eastern Kentucky dialect spoken by the characters is uneven (characters sometimes drop their &#x22;g&#x22;s at the end of words and sometimes don't), but the characterizations are interesting, and Collins pens some worthy descriptions. Readers of the first two books in the series will recognize various characters, but the novel succeeds well as a stand-alone. Although the book is ostensibly aimed at adult fiction readers, the novel's contemporary setting, teen protagonist and happily-ever-after ending should cinch its success with the YA crowd.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.","price":{"$numberDouble":"14.95"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41aU5eLcDkL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B000SHR01M","B00DAMJ5TC","B000SFA4LC","B00JDOC0WU","B00D0B8YPE","B000S1MCP2","B000SFQZ2E","B000SF599E","B00FDZ6PM4","B000SEVA02","B000SESBO0","B000SFK2HI","B000SK21LS","B000SEIA0U","B002AKPFYY","B003OYIA4M","B000SF9X6O","B004VT3GSE","B002VP0ZXY","B002U7E91M","B0072KXNY6","B003SE763E","B009EGBP96","B00IRLFD7Y","B00EXFV7OQ","B00LBGF3T0","B00IRLFH9S","B00J0CW87W","B00KDN839Y","B00KKYCSNS","B00KSNCRH8","B00KDN8646","B00JCFMXHW","B00DL0TANY","B00I5ZKRX2","B00HS99Z5M","B00IDW3NEC","B00JFHRPUW","B00F64D39A","B00GHXROW6","B00I60JFFM","B00I5SOKGO","B00I88HB1M","B00I5QX17U","B00HX7CTDO","B00KGMISAG","B001NLKSPW","B00DY9FOVO","B00HM8L1AG","B000SF2YHO","B00I5QX1A2","B00C0HOYS0","B00KGMISBK","B00KGMISE2","B00KGMIS92","B00GHXRVOM","B000SFRO06","B00GHXRLRO","B00B85M0HM","B000SEVCGY","B00KQNWA2C","B000SF5AJS","B008EGRFWI","B000SFBVC8","B00GPDUTGG","B00I3JMGIY","B000SEU3BY","B008257TYK","B0067DE258","B00GWT8FA0","B00CIUJX12","B008B9HPXC","B00GUTB0FO","B00CIUJYMK","B00GVJS1M8","B000SF1IXA","B007FZOUD6","B007LB62NA","B00J40LPSS","B003M5IHHS","B006G2YPI4","B00CIUJWLI","B000SFHCGC","B00LGNDJBM","B00A8NUGWQ","B000SF9U2Q","B000S1MI2E","B00E1O7O3W","B000S1MK8Q","B00KH9OM7Q","B001SK4JXK","B00BE9AOGG","B00DWA69NW","B00DNBE91Y","B000SFD7K2","B000FC2NXK","B009VPW8QY","B00GL3IXGI"],"buy_after_viewing":["B00JDOC0WU","B00D0B8YPE","B00FDZ6PM4","B009EGBP96"]},"categories":[["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Literature & Fiction"],["Books","Literature & Fiction","Women's Fiction","Domestic Life"],["Books","Religion & Spirituality","Fiction"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Contemporary Fiction","Christian"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Fiction"]],"genres":["Christian Books & Bibles","Contemporary Fiction","Domestic Life","Christian","Religion & Spirituality","Women's Fiction","Literature & Fiction","Fiction","Christian Fiction"]}

By learning how to handle it wisely, pastors and church leaders can make resistance one of their most valuable allies. Far from fearing conflict, leaders can turn it into a catalyst for positive change and a stronger, more united church. Through the fictional story of a typical pastor embroiled in conflict, Thriving through Ministry Conflict shows how to handle and resolve conflict in a healthy way. By working through a series of response activities and discussion questions, the reader will gain powerful insights into the emotional dynamics of conflict. Here are the knowledge and tools that can help pastors and church leaders trade self-defeating responses to conflict for an empowering, constructive approach; gain a working command of key conflict survival principles; and cultivate the skills needed to effectively navigate the conflicts every ministry leader faces.","price":{"$numberDouble":"14.04"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lY8sQnERL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B001DDGPP2","B005JSGB5Q","B008DXFBCS","B00CLJ3KXC","B00EDY1YU4","B00J8V80WC","B00C7T33ZQ","B005PRJLXU","B00GP5FO1Y","B002AKPFTO","B0039W58IA","B0010SIPOY","B007T8R18K","B007WU2S5Q","B007VD6LY8","B00DP1QPS2","B00GRZDCAW","B00ARWMR4I","B00272MATI","B0060M8JV4","B004X2JGSI","B005LOPNRU","B00DL18FP2","B001NLL9O6","B001E2WM54","B00BW2J4NO","B00G8O5CKK","B00DNI5BLY","B006T46NFW","B008DXFH5Y","B003U4UTAY","B001RS8KQA","B00858Y2Q2","B00FDULPK6","B00CJDW2D4","B007JJF780","B007WRPUFE","B00AFWM4PW","B0085BETBW","B009AT2JHE","B003Z0CMNK","B002TNGBJ0","B003RCL3W2","B00B2PPI2C","B00F1W0RD2","B0026RIBFG","B00A9UMLM6","B009QYVGJA","B000SIYT06","B007ZFIU28","B000FC2KE2"]},"categories":[["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Living","Leadership"],["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Churches & Church Leadership","Church Administration"],["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Churches & Church Leadership","Pastoral Resources"],["Books","Christian Books & Bibles","Ministry & Evangelism"],["Books","Religion & Spirituality","Religious Studies","Theology"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Christian Living","Leadership"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Churches & Church Leadership","Church Administration"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Churches & Church Leadership","Pastoral Resources"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Books & Bibles","Ministry & Evangelism","General"]],"genres":["Christian Books & Bibles","Churches & Church Leadership","Church Administration","Leadership","Pastoral Resources","General","Religion & Spirituality","Christian Living","Theology","Ministry & Evangelism","Religious Studies"]}

When Jacob becomes ill, Reisa must  leave him in the care of two Confederate veterans while she and  Dov earn enough money to help him. As they are returning to  Jacob, they find a man unconscious in the ditch and take him  home with them. Ben Driver, a veteran himself and an ex-con just  released from prison, doesn't want their help, but Reisa  gradually becomes one of the most important people in his life.  As she struggles with her grandfather's surprising conversion to  Christianity and her own feelings about Christ, events are set  in motion that could destroy her new life. Morris offers a solid  historical novel with a reasonable explanation for his  characters' religious conversion, but the repetition of a scene  from his novel The Glorious Prodigal with the appropriate  character changes mars the flow of the story.

A cost that may be more than she ever imagined . . .   There&#x2019;s nothing Chris McIntyre hates more than child abuse. And now one of the children at Kimberley Square&#x2019;s new gymnasium is showing the signs&#x2014;signs Chris knows all too well. With no evidence to take to the police, the tough-as-nails former soldier knows it&#x2019;s time to take matters into her own hands.   But her anger at the abuser goes deeper than defending an innocent child. Memories haunt Chris&#x2014;memories of her own childhood and her own father. As these memories locked inside her well up into a rage that threatens to consume her, she finds it impossible to forgive. But how can she continue as a Christian while harboring hatred in her heart?   One remarkable man may hold the answers to help Chris sort through the agonizing secrets of her past. To help her find a road to peace.

So an actor needs precise exercise and clear understanding to liberate his hidden possibilities and to learn the hard task of being true to the &#145;instinct of the moment&#146;. As her book points out with remarkable persuasiveness &#145;technique&#146; as such is a myth, for there is no such thing as a correct voice. There is no right way&#151;there are only a million wrong ways, which are wrong because they deny what would otherwise be affirmed. Wrong uses of the voice are those that constipate feeling, constrict activity, blunt expression, level out idiosyncrasy, generalize experience, coarsen intimacy. These blockages are multiple and are the results of acquired habits that have become part of the automatic vocal equipment; unnoticed and unknown, they stand between the actor&#39;s voice as it is and as it could be and they will not vanish by themselves. So the work is not how to do but how to permit: how, in fact, to set the voice free. And since life in the voice springs from emotion, drab and uninspiring technical exercises can never be sufficient. Cicely Berry never departs from the fundamental recognition that speaking is part of a whole: an expression of inner life&#133;. After a voice session with her I have known actors speak not of the voice but of a growth in human relationships. This is a high tribute to work that is the opposite of specialization. Cicely Berry sees the voice teacher as involved in all of a theatre&#39;s work. She would never try to separate the sound of words from their living context. For her the two are inseparable. &#151;from Peter Brook&#39;s foreword to Voice and the Actor","price":{"$numberDouble":"9.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51o-xyTLPcL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B003WJRDTW","B00593JN9C","B00755MIB2","B0074VTGLW","B003FCVGB2","B00BHOSEQ0","B001O9AQTQ","B00CS6VFHQ","B003FCVG76","B00BAH7PQY","B00C36RTJY","B004WOF28A","B00JQ3FN7M","B00CDUUPGE","B003T0G9E4","B002STNBKW","B002AWX5Y4","B000FC2O8E","B00BD436Z8","B0049P1M3G","B00CKNWAM6","B00CTYCGIY","B0083DJRG4","B0017SWQGA","B009QJMVV2","B0063LJEUC","B007704HRS","B007QPFFXY","B0047T748Q","B007HD7HT0","B00CKNWAO4","B00822WM2M","B00BRY1AF2","B00AC27VKI","B002I5E466","B003TXRVPW","B001IBHX0K"],"buy_after_viewing":["B00593JN9C","B003FCVGB2","B00755MIB2"]},"categories":[["Books","Arts & Photography","Performing Arts","Theater","Acting & Auditioning"],["Books","Humor & Entertainment","Television"],["Books","Reference","Words, Language & Grammar","Speech"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Arts & Photography","Theater","Acting & Auditioning"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Humor & Entertainment","Television"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Reference","Words, Language & Grammar","Speech"]],"genres":["Humor & Entertainment","Theater","Performing Arts","Speech","Words, Language & Grammar","Arts & Photography","Reference","Acting & Auditioning","Television"]}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963c91"},"asin":"B000SIGY7W","description":"Allan Schore reveals himself as a polymath, the depth and breadth of whose reading, bringing together neurobiology, developmental neurochemistry, behavioral neurology, evolutionary biology, developmental psychology, developmental psychoanalysis and infant psychiatry, is staggering. This is a superb work, an excellent source book for psychiatrists wishing to locate their work within the much broader study of the mind. It might also form the basis of what could be an enormously creative dialogue between neurobiology and psychoanalysis.&#8212;British Journal of PsychiatryAllan Schore['s]...work is leading to an integrated evidence-based dynamic theory of human development that will engender a rapprochment between psychiatry and neural sciences.&#8212;American Journal of PsychiatrySchore's...model explicates in exemplary detail the precise mechanisms by which the infant brain might internalize and structuralize the affect-regulating functions of the mother, in circumscribed neural tissues, at specifiable points in its epigenetic history....I unreservedly recommend this uniquely informative book to psychoanalytic readers.&#8212;Journal of the American Psychoanalytic AssociationIn this extensively researched (over 2,300 references) and cogently argued text, Allen N. Schore provides a major contribution to the study of the relationship between the neurological processes and structures of the brain and the socioaffective and object representational phenomena that we generally associate with the mind. Schore's approach is an outstanding example of the genre of studies seeking to demonstrate neurological isomorphisms for the kind of mental or psychic states that have been postulated by psychoanalytic theory.&#8212;Psychoanalytic QuarterlyFor those who read this book, the study of human development will be entirely transformed....Not only is this book destined to be an authoritative reference for those who work with infants and children, but it also promises to radically restructure many of our current paradigms of infant/child development and care....it is perhaps the first comprehensive source to emotional development. Its scholarship is indeed impressive. Its integration and conclusions are insightful.&#8212;Contemporary EducationAllan Schore'sAffect Regulation and the Origin of the Selfis a brilliant, if not awesome, synthesis with supporting data from a spectrum of many disparate sources, including anatomic, developmental, neurochemical, and psychodynamic. He has developed a coherent and integrated neuropsychological model of the location, development, and mechanism of the self.&#8212;International Society for the Study of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine...this is a superb integrative work, an excellent source book and required reading for any psychiatrists wishing to locate their work within the much broader study of mind.&#8212;The British Journal of PsychiatryIn this remarkable and unique integrative contribution on socioaffective ontogeny, Dr. Schore has assembled an incredible array of data that spans virtually the length and breadth of modern science, including neurobiology, developmental neurochemistry, behavioral neurology, evolutionary biology, sociobiology, developmental psychology, developmental psychoanalysis, and infant psychiatry. His aim in this work is to construct an interdisciplinary model for the attainment of optimum integration from all these disciplines so that we see a more transcendent picture of the emerging human infant as a neurobiological-social-emotionalself.I believe that he has achieved his aim and, in so doing, he has lifted our neurobiological 'hardware' into a unique costarring role with our mental (cognitive/affective) software and has highlighted how our neurons become key players in the formation of our personalities. We can almost now see brain and mind in a paradoxically discontinuously continuous M&#246;bius strip connection....a pioneering work that holds considerable promise for everyone in the behavioral sciences. It fundamentally alters our traditional, fundamentalistic, cyclopean psychodynamic way of viewing infants and patients and dramatically informs a newer and much needed interdisciplinary perspective.&#8212;James S. Grotstein, M.D.University of California at Los Angeles Medical School, From the ForewordUnlike most scientists, Dr. Schore takes his inspiration from the interfaces between disciplines. In this book, he makes a heroic effort to link the worlds of the cell, the brain, behavior, and inferred emotional states through their common participation in regulatory processes at work within the early relationship of the child and its parents. He offers both original ideas and an exceptionally broad survey of recent research in all these areas.&#8212;Myron A. HoferCollege of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University...a remarkable feat of scholarship and a very important contribution to the neurobiology of emotional development. I like your pattern of reviewing and discussing the psychological and social side of development, followed usually by a chapter that looks at the neurobiology. This truly offers the integration that you were seeking, and I congratulate you for what you have done.&#8212;Richard S. LazarusUniversity of California, Berkeleya superb book....I am sure to refer to it repeatedly and will continue to rely on the references.&#8212;Karl H.

The duo throw caution&mdash;and their bare behinds&mdash;to the wind every Thursday afternoon in trysts along deserted, woody banks of the Thames. As it gets colder outside, Ginnie and Will (aka Detective Inspector Hampden) seek privacy in an abandoned river house. One day, &#x22;entangled&#x22; inside with her &#x22;smoke and cinnamon&#x22; scented lover, Ginnie spies a suspicious-looking man by the river. Initially unnerved, she dismisses her reaction as projected guilt&mdash;until a woman is found murdered near that very spot. Thus begins the real conflict in this atmospheric love &ndash;story&ndash;cum&ndash;psychological thriller. Should Ginnie remain silent, potentially allowing a murderer to go free? Or should she speak up, and thereby expose her affair and ruin two marriages? As she frets over the decision, all the while juggling a career, an emotionally aloof husband, a difficult 16-year-old daughter and an ailing mother, Ginnie seems less a heroine and more a hapless fly caught in a moral spider web. Leroy manages to make Ginnie sympathetic&mdash;even though she isn't always likable&mdash;and her dilemma chillingly real.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This isn&#x92;t about joining anyone&#x92;s religious club&#x97;it&#x92;s about being real with yourself and with the others in your group. Since no one has all the answers, there&#x92;s plenty of room for discussion. After all, if there is any truth to the Bible&#x92;s stories about Jesus, then one thing he&#x92;d welcome are questions and opinions that come from honest, earnest hearts.Miracles? Rising from the dead? God Incarnate? Some people say such claims about Jesus are myths and lies. Yet through the years countless others, beginning with Jesus&#x92; closest friends, have staked their lives on the accuracy of those claims. Fortunately, faith is not a leap in the dark. In Clear Evidence, you&#x92;ll weigh the arguments for and against the Jesus of the Bible. How convincing is the case for either side? The verdict is yours.Clear Evidence includes these sessions:  Credible Sources  A Brush with Greatness  Reason, Faith, and . . . Miracles?  The Finish Line  Final Proof  Skeptics TurnFor the Group Leader Reality Check is for spiritual seekers of every persuasion. Uncompromisingly Christian in its perspective, it steers wide of pat answers and aims at honesty. This innovative and thought-provoking series will challenge you and those in your group to connect heart to heart as together you explore the interface between Jesus, the Bible, and the realities of this world in which we live.","author":null,"title":"Clear Evidence: Eyewitness Reports of Jesus (Reality Check)","genres":["New Testament Study","Two hours or more (65-100 pages)","New Testament","Guides","Christian Books & Bibles","Education","Kindle Short Reads","Bible Study & Reference","Reference","Religion & Spirituality","Religious Studies & Reference","Bible Study"]}

They discover a hidden tunnel under the Burger Castle, the Funkhouser family's restaurant, and encounter a weird apparition floating in the air. Deciding that ghosts would make an unbeatable project, they begin to research the Castle's history. They learn that it was once owned by inventor Silas Finklebean, who vanished mysteriously. When they find his laboratory and logbook of plans, they attempt to reconstruct his time machine. Meanwhile, town bully Adam Spanker and his father, owners of the rival Patty Cakes restaurant, are plotting to drive the Funkhousers out of business. Can Freddy and the Fries find a way to save the Castle? The over-the-top action is often difficult to follow and there is little depth of character. The pervasive body and insult humor is reminiscent of a second-grade playground. Black-and-white cartoon illustrations are mildly amusing, but add little. Adult thriller author Baldacci is aiming at Captain Underpants graduates, but this novel lacks both the imagination and the underlying logic of that gleefully anarchic series.

For a half-century, these authors have relentlessly advocated a family perspective in human services, and have creatively demonstrated how family-focused care can be done. This valuable book is both an inspiration and a practical resource for practitioners and administrators in all fields of human service.&#x22;--Gordon Harper, MD, Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts Department of Mental Health&#160;&#x22;This wonderful second edition contains powerful new case examples that have expanded the authors' seminal work with poor families into many different areas.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963ce0"},"asin":"B000SKFHOG","description":"This new edition of Thurber's (1894-1961) correspondence to friends, family, lovers, fellow writers and, of course, New Yorker colleagues runs almost three times the length of the Selected Letters. A maturing portrait emerges, from bumptious young State Department code clerk during WWI to the man behind Walter Mitty, and the milieu of the old New Yorker comes similarly to life. The early letters to his Ohio State fraternity pal and college sweetheart are both sophomoric and romantic. After being posted to Paris and returning to the U.S. at the height of the Roaring 20s, Thurber's stylistic craftsmanship has begun to catch up with his sophisticated wit, which comes to fruition when he joins Harold Ross's New Yorker to edit, write, and rewrite &#x22;Talk of the Town&#x22; and draw dog cartoons. Thurber employs comedy adeptly and variously to woo several objects of affection and infatuation, to spar with the editorially prickly Ross and to construct droll personae to deal with life's predicaments and to amuse his recipients. The letters hit their peak of hilarity and exuberance in the late 1920s, just before he achieves unexpected fame as a bestselling author, with E.B. White, of Is Sex Necessary?. The chief pleasures here are the free and uncensored jokes (and drawings) and the occasional glimpses, behind Thurber's authorial mask, of a disappointed lover, discontented spirit, Civil War buff and Henry James devotee. For all the padding with prosaic entries, this carnival of correspondence, edited by Thurber's daughter and his biographer, fulfills its promise of wit and wisdom. 16 pages of b&#x26;w photos, 15 line drawings.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.","price":{"$numberDouble":"0.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515r2bqj9gL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_viewed":["B0049B22R0","B00HHE9H24","B0073VRNYU","B002SAUC0I","B00GWXR83G","B0049B22UM","B00L6K4RQQ","B0082XQSBW","B0083DJXJK","B00IWA4FMY","B0049B22ZC","B00452V3XW","B003JMENRW","B007GY7A9W","B004Y64PCU","B005UG14IG","B00848W3H8","B009NFHF0Q"],"buy_after_viewing":["B0049B22R0","B00HHE9H24","B0073VRNYU","B002SAUC0I"]},"categories":[["Books","Biographies & Memoirs","Arts & Literature","Authors"],["Books","Literature & Fiction","Essays & Correspondence","Letters & Correspondence"],["Books","Literature & Fiction","History & Criticism","Movements & Periods"],["Books","Literature & Fiction","United States","Classics"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Biographies & Memoirs","Arts & Literature","Authors"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Essays & Correspondence","Letters & Correspondence"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","History & Criticism","Criticism & Theory"]],"genres":["Criticism & Theory","Classics","Authors","History & Criticism","Biographies & Memoirs","Literature & Fiction","Letters & Correspondence","Movements & Periods","United States","Arts & Literature","Essays & Correspondence"]}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963cec"},"asin":"B000SMQG2G","description":"&#x22;Patrick Cohrs' The Unfinished Peace after World War I brilliantly renews the genre of classic international history. Based on massive archival scholarship and elegantly written, his study focuses on American and British roles and asks why a stable European security system could not be consolidated between the Versailles Treaty and the advent of Hitler. Ultimately, he argues, it fell to London and Washington to help Paris and Berlin overcome distrust, nationalism, and impatience with the slow pace of mutual concessions. High stakes, alas, could not guarantee success, but failure was not foreordained. There are important lessons here for the Middle East and other regional conflicts. In the end there are no outsiders.&#x22;-Charles S. Maier, Leverett Saltonstall Professor of History, Harvard University&#x22;Historians have usually seen 1924-29 as no more than a temporary lull between the two storm periods of imposed &#x22;peace&#x22; settlements and bitter conflicts in 1919-23 and the Great Depression, destruction of Versailles, and rise of Hitler in 1929-33. Patrick Cohrs argues in this massively-researched, detailed study that the Dawes Plan, London Conference, and Locarno treaties of 1924-25 constituted instead a new Euro-Atlantic peace settlement and international system and established a new European concert. Under combined British-American aegis, both France and Germany adopted the spirit and politics of productive mutual compromise. What stunted and finally undermined the system was above all the failure of both hegemons, especially America, actively to support and develop it. Everyone who wants to understand this era, as well as the origins of World War II and the workings of modern international politics, must come to terms with this highly controversial but often illuminating and persuasive interpretation.&#x22;-Paul W. Schroeder, Emeritus Professor of History and Political Science, University of Illinois&#x22;This is an ambitious book with a challenging thesis. It re-examines British and American policy towards Europe in the 1920s sympathetically, arguing that policy makers in both countries made a serious effort to promote peaceful solutions which reflected their values as well as national interests. The conclusions, which are well-documented, offer an important new interpretation of the period.&#x22;-Jonathan Wright, Christ Church, University of Oxford&#x22;Cohrs takes a refreshing and well-balanced perspective, striking a reasonable compromise between a variety of historical approaches... his study not only reveals a wide range of primary sources that bring to light a  convincing revisionist interpretation of the early inter war period, but it also makes an important statement about the climate of international relations at the time... it is a masterpiece of research and one that should  significantly change the way we see the inter war period.&#x22;-Journal of British Studies&#x22;Cohrs marshals an impressive amount of evidence for his assertion by mining archival resources in both public and private collections in the US, Britain, France, Germany, and the League of Nations. The primary research is backed up with a command of the voluminous secondary literature on this period.&#x22;-Frederic Krome, American Jewish Archives/Hebrew Union College&#x22;This is a highly original and thought-provoking book. Patrick Cohrs, adopting a systemic approach to his subject, argues that the Anglo-American agreements of 1923-5 laid the foundations for a stable peace in Europe and inaugurated an American-dominated Euro-Atlantic system that lasted until it was disrupted by the unprecedented world depression. ... Cohrs' challenging thesis forces one to reconsider the process of European stabilisation in the 1920s, and to reassess the nature of the American contribution to its limited success.&#x22;-The English Historical Review&#x22;In this opus magnum the author has re-examined extensive archival holdings and private papers and ... with an assured grasp of his subject provided an original interpretation...&#x22;-Historische Zeitschrift&#x22;...as well as making a significant contribution to the scholarly debate about the 1920s, Cohrs' book also serves as a useful reminder of the difficulties that attend peacemaking, and the long-term commitment that is required to make it succeed.&#x22;-Times Literary Supplement&#x22;Patrick O. Cohrs offers a major reinterpretation of post-World War I international history... Much of the best scholarship on [this period] focuses on either European or transatlantic relations. To his credit, Cohrs combines both in his study of the Euro-Atlantic order. He places Locarno diplomacy of 1925-1929-the new European concert-within a transatlantic framework.&#x22;-American Historical Review&#x22;Cohrs convincingly argues that we are wrong to view the 1920s as a decade of false dawns simply preordaining a decade when much worse was to follow. The book is especially important because a study that includes the American dimension to what many scholars have tended to view exclusively from a European perspective is long overdue.&#x22;-History&#x22;...Patrick O. Cohrs has contributed a mammoth study... In this fine revisionist work, Cohrs argues that European and American policy-makers... were able to create a viable transatlantic international order in the 1920s, which constituted an important accomplishment in the history of international relations and was not inexorably doomed to fail.&#x22;-Peace and Change&#x22;...there is no doubt that specialists of twentieth-century history, diplomatic history, and international politics, as well as scholars interested in research on the two world wars will find in it a lot to stimulate their reflection. All university libraries should naturally have a copy.&#x22; -Antoine Capet, H-Diplo&#x22;...a provocative thesis....a book well worth reading...&#x22;--Carole Fink, Ohio State University, Journal of Modern History","price":{"$numberDouble":"8.44"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tNVodwcfL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B00AKE1S1G"]},"categories":[["Books","History","Americas","United States"],["Books","History","Europe"],["Books","History","Military","World War I"],["Books","History","World"],["Books","Politics & Social Sciences","Politics & Government","International & World Politics","European"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","History","Americas","United States","20th Century"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","History","Europe"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","History","World","20th Century"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Politics & Social Sciences","Politics & Government","International & World Politics","Relations"]],"genres":["Politics & Social Sciences","Politics & Government","History","World","20th Century","European","Europe","Americas","United States","International & World Politics","Relations","World War I","Military"]}

Savage was born in Norridgewock, Maine in 1841. He graduated from the Bangor Theological Seminary in 1864, and for nine years was in the Congregational ministry, being a home missionary at San Mateo and Grass Valley, California, until 1867. He held pastorates at Framingham, Massachusetts from 1867 to 1869, and at Hannibal, Missouri from 1869 to 1873. Savage then became a Unitarian, and was pastor of the Third Unitarian Church of Chicago from 1873 to 1874, of the Church of the Unity in Boston from 1874 to 1896, and of the Church of the Messiah (now renamed the Community Church) in New York City from 1896 to 1906. He was an active advocate of Darwinian evolutionistic optimism and social reform, and he also preached a spiritualistic faith in personal survival after death. His sermons were distributed in the pamphlets Unity Pulpit and Messiah Pulpit.  He wrote many books, including Christianity, the Science of Manhood (1873), The Religion of Evolution (1876), The Morals of Evolution (1880), The Religious Life (1885), My Creed (1887), Religious Reconstruction (1888), The Evolution of Christianity (1892), Our Unitarian Gospel (1898), The Passing and the Permanent in Religion (1901), Life Beyond Death (1901), Can Telepathy Explain? (1902), Life's Dark Problems (1905), Immortality (1906), and, in addition to other volumes in verse, America to England (1905). He was a director of the American Unitarian Association, and served on several councils and conferences. In 1896 he was granted an honorary doctor of divinity degree from Harvard University in 1896","price":{"$numberDouble":"5.6"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mPnNsZCVL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B007V2UDZC","B004OEKCVK","B0065M52EG","B005LD5P1U","B008Z0ZCHS","B0053TCMN6","B003MC5D0A","B00BQVVQTQ","B004Q7CI4E","B003ZSIT16","B0055T8K26","B003UYURQK","B0028AEFS8","B004OEKADK","B004Q7CJS4","B002WYJGOS","B005H49S8Y","B004AYCU7I","B0098PTUEK","B007OXGLTU","B001BDI55M","B00B7Y3D8E","B005FHOVOO","B001U0Q17K","B008O5NQ90","B0090810JI","B00CHCP9RS","B0060M388S","B003XNTFB6","B002SR2Q9G","B008MPCQN4","B0046A9RU4","B0085WDWB4","B003DZ1J2M","B00315684S","B007EC5CTG","B006077NYI","B00803FAKE","B002CZQFTQ","B002UKONFQ","B00CBLEB1K","B003E5H82Q","B002Y26QS2","B006O28DR0","B00267RV20","B00338QEO2","B007H9RGOK","B003T9V9A4","B004VGUCNY","B00AHP5U4Y","B004YTPAP8","B002EL3SJI","B001NLL5FO","B00608FZV0","B00ADEABAM","B005HIY5ZG","B004H1TUJU","B004OEKBNE","B0052ZR5PQ","B00BRA8V1M","B005KL7X9K","B00DH3YBXE","B004OYTGHQ","B004PYDMCA","B003NSC5IG","B0098PEAN6","B009SJZNS8","B004FGLS0G","B0078XFHT6","B00BEJXTHC","B00853XTLQ","B004OYTOJQ","B0076P3ZZ4","B00802AWA8","B002TG4P4K","B0095KJ8EU","B005JPEA2U","B004HO5G54","B00795VHOM","B007WKEMCI","B003UV8ZZ8"],"buy_after_viewing":["B007V2UDZC","B004OEKCVK","B00BQVVQTQ","B004GHNIRK"]},"categories":[["Books","History","Europe","Great Britain"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","History","Europe","England"]],"genres":["Europe","Great Britain","England","History"]}

For a scientist, his analysis of case law in this field is exceptionally informative and provocative.&#x22;--Ellen K. Silbergeld, PhD, Professor, Environmental Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health&#x22;Cranor's insightful discussions of science and law as it is seen by the  Courts in toxic tort litigation is a &#x22;must read&#x22; for scientists in  toxicology, epidemiology, and pharmacology.&#x22;---Eula Bingham PhD, Professor, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati&#x22;Toxic Torts is a powerful dissection of the use of science in our system of justice. Professor Cranor has written an important book that examines why most victims of toxic exposures never receive the compensation they deserve.&#x22;---David Michaels, PhD, MPH, Director,The Project on Scientific Knowledge and Public Policy, and Research Professor and Associate Chairman, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, The George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services&#x22;Carl Cranor's exceptionally lucid analysis of science in regulation and litigation reveals brilliantly why circumstantial evidence currently can convict a dangerous person but not a toxic chemical.&#x22;--Sheldon Krimsky, Professor. Department of Urban & Environmental Policy & Planning, Tufts University&#x22;This highly sophisticated examination of science's role in toxic tort litigation is presented so clearly that even a lay reader can comprehend the impact the courts' views on science are having on everyday lives.&#x22;Margaret A. Berger, Suzanne J. and Norman Miles Professor of Law, Brooklyn Law School&#x22;This is a work of scholarship, dealing with the interactions of law and science in relation to personal injury litigation...The author's disquisitions on  the disciplines of epidemiology, statistics, and toxicology, and on their  limitations, are instructive for lawyers and legislators who require to wrestle with scientific evidence and expert opinions, while his exposition of legal principles will  inform the scientist. This book commends itself to all of their bookshelves,  after first being read.&#x22;--- MORRIS GREENBERG, MB, FRCP, FFOM&#x22;Toxic Torts makes a substantial contribution to the ongoing debate concerning the admissibility of expert witness testimony and its role in proving causation in toxic tort suits...Researchers and scientists will also come away from reading the book with a greater understanding of how the judicial system incorporates their work into its quest to make justice, perhaps encouraging &#x22;greater acceptance of legal decisions in the scientifc community [and] greater scientifc participation in the legal system.&#x22;79&#x22;-Devin Brennan&#x22;TOXIC TORTS is an excellent book, filled with keen observations about the science/law interaction, the epistemic structure of scientific inquiry, the norms and conventions which regulate the community of researchers, and the special difficulties faced by the torts [*108] system in obtaining justice and deterring malfeasance in toxic tort cases.&#x22;--- Andrew T.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963d18"},"asin":"B000SSULV2","description":"&#x22;You're on in five.&#x22; Cameraman Lance Johnson pointed the lens on Ciara Miller, general assignment reporter  for  Philadelphia's WTCF-FOX  Channel Twenty-Nine News.&#x22;Wait a sec,&#x22; Ciara replied, smoothing down her shoulder-length hair with one hand while holding the microphone in the other. She was about to speak when the roar of ambulance sirens screamed in the background. Once they were no longer within earshot, she turned away from the devastating murder-suicide scene in front of her on a balmy afternoon in early July.Lance smiled as he looked through the lens. Ciara was breathtaking. He was captivated by her smooth bronze skin, brilliant hazel eyes, full lips and defiant chin. Ciara had a way of seducing the camera with her delicately carved features and exotically high cheekbones. The honey-blond hair surrounding her ovalshaped face only added to her allure. The new hair color was daring but not too bold as to offend viewers. She'd said she wanted to make a statement, and that she had. Ciara was always the epitome of fashion and today was no exception. She was wearing killer-red Prada pumps, a slim black skirt and a vibrant red silk blouse.He'd known Ciara for the last five years since they'd both begun working at WTCF fresh out of college. Barely making minimum wage, they'd been paired together and had instantly developed a rapport. Their long hours and grunt work had paid off as they'd steadily moved their way up the newsroom ladder. Ciara was now a staff reporter and Lance an assistant photographer, but Ciara had bigger dreams and he knew she would achieve them; the girl had tenacity.Lance gave her a thumbs-up signal, lifted the camera on his shoulder and directed it her way. Poised and ready for battle, Ciara gave the on-screen intro to her package for the second block of the five o'clock news.&#x22;The scene here today turned deadly for a young wife and mother,&#x22; Ciara said as the camera focused in on the Spanish-style home that now served as a crime scene. &#x22;Hector Rodriguez accused his wife of infidelity and then turned the gun on her and then himself late yesterday evening. Witnesses say that Mrs. Rodriguez came home yesterday to discover her husband enraged after she was late coming home from work. Neighbors say they heard loud voices before hearing gunshots.Authorities indicate that Hector Rodriguez trashed the home in a jealous rage before shooting himself and his wife. Detectives indicate that a full investigation will take place. This is Ciara Miller reporting for WTCFFOX News.&#x22; Ciara smiled into the camera.&#x22;How was I?&#x22; she asked, batting her long curly eyelashes at her best friend and coworker. She absolutely adored Lance. He knew her inside and out. She could always be real with him. It was a shame he was so darn smart and good-looking, and with that athletic physique she could eat him up with a spoon. &#x22;Unh, unh, unh, unh,&#x22; Ciara murmured, shaking her head. But she couldn't go there, they'd decided a long time ago that they'd rather have a platonic relationship than ruin a great friendship.&#x22;Beautiful as always,&#x22; Lance replied, turning off the camera and closing the lens cover. &#x22;And you know that.&#x22; He set the camera inside the open OB truck that he used to send live feeds back to the newsroom.&#x22;Yeah, I do,&#x22; Ciara said grinning, &#x22;but a little praise never hurt.&#x22; She watched the medical examiner's van drive away as the police secured the perimeter of the crime scene.Lance wrapped the cord around his arm and walked it back to the truck. &#x22;Since when do you need to be told you're fabulous? You know you've got what it takes.&#x22;&#x22;Have you told that to Shannon recently?&#x22; Ciara asked. &#x22;Because she won't give me a break. She keeps sending me out for lightweight entertainment stories. Today was the first time I've gotten to report breaking news.&#x22;Ciara had tried for months to convince WTCF's new television director, Shannon Wright, that she was more than a pretty face, to no avail. Had Shannon even looked at her r&eacute;sum&eacute;?She'd been at the top of her class at Johns Hopkins and had obtained a master's degree in journalism at Columbia University. She'd worked at Columbia's television station, theColumbia Daily Spectatorand the yearbook. She was a member of the National Association of Black Journalists and had worked at the station for over five years. She'd started out as a production assistant before moving on to become a general assignment reporter.Ciara excelled at pushing herself. So what if that interfered with her cultivating lasting personal relationships; she was willing to make the sacrifice to get to the top of the heap. Her looks wouldn't last forever. Talent was the key.&#x22;You'll have your day,&#x22; Lance said. &#x22;You just have to be patient.&#x22;&#x22;As you well know, patience is not one of my virtues,&#x22; Ciara replied.&#x22;Ain't that the truth,&#x22; Lance laughed, opening the passenger side. &#x22;You'd better get in. I've got to get back and edit the footage.&#x22;Ciara hopped up in the van and buckled her seat belt while he closed the door. Lance may have thought that was the end of it, but Ciara had other ideas.&#x22;Now is not the right time for me to announce my candidacy,&#x22; Jonathan Butler said to his father, Congressman Charles Butler, and Reid Hamilton, his father's chief of staff and personal adviser. They were in his father's office strategizing on Jonathan's campaign while his father paced the floor reciting the speech he was going to give to the press the following day. &#x22;I should let you step down first. I don't want to appear overly zealous.&#x22;Charles smiled as he watched his son. Admiration shone through in his oval-shaped brown eyes at his son's stately presence. Six foot three with massive shoulders, his son towered over other men, including him. He carried himself with the same dignity and grace that Charles had conveyed during his twentyfive-year tenure serving the good people of Philadelphia. He had a bright future ahead of him and had done the right thing starting off in law before becoming an alderman. Charles was sure that Jonathan would be as capable a leader as he was. It was just a shame that he had to step down because of a heart condition.&#x22;Why not announce it at your father's retirement press conference tomorrow? It would be a prime opportunity with maximum coverage,&#x22; Reid replied.&#x22;I agree with Reid,&#x22; his father said. &#x22;Capitol Hill has been rumoring for months that you'll take over my seat. Why not end all the speculation?&#x22; Charles was sure the press would be eager to meet his handsome, dark-haired son.&#x22;How would it appear to the public if I announced my candidacy directly after your speech? It would show a complete lack of respect for what a wonderful congressman you've been. The public would see me as a capitalist.&#x22;&#x22;There will never be a right time,&#x22; Charles Butler returned.&#x22;That may be true, Dad, but now is definitely not it. I haven't even hired a campaign manager or a media consultant.&#x22; He'd done some preliminary legwork by getting an office, but there was still more to be done.Jonathan saw the shocked expression on Reid's face. Reid must have assumed that because he served as his father's campaign manager that he was the logical choice for Jonathan. Jonathan, however, had other ideas. He appreciated Reid's input thus far, but he wanted someone he knew and trusted leading his campaign, and his best friend, Zach Powers, was just that man.Jonathan intended to speak with Zach over lunch. Zach had just finished a successful campaign with Governor Green and Jonathan was sure Zach could do the same for him.&#x22;I'm sorry, Reid.&#x22; Jonathan folded his arms across his chest. &#x22;I meant to speak with you. I hope there are no hard feelings?&#x22; Jonathan extended his right hand.&#x22;No, not at all.&#x22; Reid returned the handshake and faked a smile.His father spoke up on Reid's behalf. &#x22;Jonathan&#133;&#x22; &#x22;It's okay, Charles,&#x22; Reid interrupted him. &#x22;If Jonathan wants to hire his own right hand, leave him be.&#x22;&#x22;No, it's not fair,&#x22; Charles Butler huffed. &#x22;You're practically a member of this family. Jonathan, why would you even think of going with a stranger?&#x22; &#x22;Dad, I've made my choice and I don't intend on arguing about this. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a few items to attend to.&#x22; Jonathan grabbed his overcoat and leather briefcase sitting on the floor and headed out the door.Once the door closed, Charles faced his best friend and closest adviser. &#x22;Don't worry, Reid. I'll talk to him.&#x22;&#x22;Don't bother,&#x22; Reid said. &#x22;If your son feels he can find a better man to lead his team then by all means let him.&#x22;&#x22;Thank you for understanding.&#x22; Charles patted Reid's back and walked back to his desk.&#x22;No problem,&#x22; Reid said and grabbed the folder of notes he'd previously prepared on Jonathan's campaign and walked to the door. &#x22;I'll leave you to your speech.&#x22; Reid closed the door behind himself.Livid, he stalked back to his office and shut the door. He slammed the file on his maple desk and plopped down in his swivel chair.How dare that two-bit snot disrespect him in such a manner? After everything he had done for the Butler family, after all the hours he'd spent, the personal sacrifices he'd made and Jonathan dared hire another manager? Who did he think had helped Charles get elected? Reid was responsible for Charles Butler's successful twenty-five-year run in Congress every bit as much as the man himself.Reid knew the ins and outs of politics more than most. He'd had over thirty years in the business. He'd run all of Charles Butler's campaigns and won every single one of them. Jonathan had no idea what it took to win an election. What he needed was to be taught a lesson&#151;he couldn't mess with a real man. Reid would show him that he would not be tossed away like the gum on the bottom of his preppy-boy shoe.Oh yes, Reid mused, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

Former Connecticut neighbor Allen definitely falls in the first category--all Martha, all the way. There is little, in fact, to report on the negative front; Allen had ample access to family and friends to paint a flattering portrait. To be sure, her ego reads loud and clear, like her yearbook quote: &#x22;I do what I please and I do it with ease.&#x22; Tracing her background back to the Kostyra household, he touches on her multitude of successes--in modeling, stock brokerage, catering, and book publishing and as CEO--along with the well-documented ImClone troubles. Occasionally, as a seeming sop to the critics, he'll add a few words of so-called objectivity--for instance, she had &#x22;trouble connecting with people on an intimate level.&#x22; On the whole, nothing is probed in detail; it's fairly clear that this not-so-authorized bio has been blessed by the powers that be.Barbara JacobsCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

No serious student of Dante can afford to ignore this book.&#x22; --Renaissance Quarterly&#x22;Christian Moevs'sMetaphysics of Dante's Comedyis a brilliant book. From beginning to end Moevs compels us to rethink Dante's poem.The Metaphysics of Dante's Comedyis a remarkable book and a major contribution to our understanding ofCommedia. --Warren Ginsburg, University of Oregon&#x22;Christian Moevs has written the first truly comprehensive account of Dante's metaphysics. All the theories about creation, separate substances, relation between the intellect and the world of contingencies are finally put in their proper relationship with his poetic vision.  This fresh, careful, and lucid examination of three notoriously complex cantos of Paradiso (XXVII, XXVIII, and XXIX) dismantles formalist accounts of the poem and it amounts to a persuasive argument in favor of its deeper theology.&#x22;--Giuseppe Mazzotta, Charles C. and Dorathea S.

A text written with elegance, verve, and precision, which one cannot put down until the end.&#x22;--Il Sole-24 Ore&#x22;This is a wonderful book, integral, ordered, developed, culminating, like Dante's poeticized universe, in the point of it all, the apprehension of Being.  Moevs writes beautifully: he is clear--elegantly clear--in a prose that nonetheless expresses complex ideas.  This is a major contribution that makes us appreciate how, in Dante, being relates to Being. One of my colleagues told me that he considered this a dangerous book.  I told him that I considered that one of its strengths. Insisting on, even magnifying, the metaphysical/mystical side of Dante, Moevs is trying to set the Commedia into relation with other great thinkers and other religions.&#x22;--Robert Hollander, Emeritus Professor in European Literature, Princeton University&#x22;It would be difficult to summarize all the lines of dazzling argument presented by Moevs...The implications of these principles for reading theCommediaare explored through senstive close reading, leading to fresh interpretations of passages from all threecantiche.  The consequences of Moevs' analysis of Dante's metaphysics not only bear upon readings of individual passages.  They touch some of the most important and controversial questions surrounding theCommediaas a whole.&#x22;--Vittorio Montemaggi, Churchill College, Cambridge.","genres":["Criticism & Theory","Books & Reading","Medieval","Politics & Social Sciences","Metaphysics","General","History & Criticism","Religion & Spirituality","Religious Studies & Reference","Literature & Fiction","Religious","Philosophy","Religious Studies","Movements & Periods"]}

The balanced selection of women and men is similar  to that found in Henry Louis Gates's Norton Anthology of African  American Literature (LJ 2/01/97), but the inclusion of  lesser-known figures and works is aimed at focusing on the  ideology of the renaissance, gay and lesbian themes, and  differences in gender-based issues. Countee Cullen, Nella  Larsen, and Zora Neale Hurston are among the authors  represented, and the selected works include essays, poetry,  prose, and drama, with lyrics and visual art used as  illustration. The editors also break with the tendency to define  the beginning and end of the renaissance with political events  by focusing on specific literary works, which allows them to  broaden the period to 1916-37. Both editors have done previous  research in the field of African American women's literature and  include a biographical sketch of each writer to underline how  their gender, class, and sexual orientation shaped their work.

This noise results from the combination of wishful thinking on the part of research and industry and a lack of clear understanding of how Web services came to be. These factors make it extremely difficult to get a coherent picture of what Web services are, what they contribute, and where they will be applied.    Based on their academic and industrial experience in middleware and enterprise application integration, Alonso and his co-authors clarify the fundamental concepts behind Web services and present them as the natural evolution of conventional middleware necessary to meet the challenges of the Web and of B2B application integration. From this perspective, it becomes clear why Web services are needed and how this technology addresses such needs.    Rather than providing a reference guide or a manual on how to write a Web service, the authors discuss challenges and solutions that will remain relevant regardless of how emerging standards and technologies evolve. Thus, this book is ideally suited for both professionals involved in application integration projects and researchers and students interested in understanding and contributing to the evolution of application integration technologies.","genres":["Structured Design","Web Design","Economics","Web Development & Design","Education & Reference","Database Design","E-Commerce","Software Design, Testing & Engineering","Programming","Computers & Technology","Internet, Groupware, & Telecommunications","Networking","Commerce","Business & Money","Internet & Web Culture","Industries","Databases","Web Services","E-commerce"]}

Despite numerous attempts, no philosopher, scientific observer, or cultural theoretician has managed to describe its essential nature or to circumscribe its proper boundaries-and no wonder. The virtue of Randall Styers's compelling study is not that it finally succeeds in defining magic with clarity-an impossible and patently misguided objective. Instead, through a meticulous and incisive examination of the major and minor writers on the subject, Styers shows that the highly pliable, always shifty, devious, and problematic category of magic has been an extremely effective device with which to define and to empower that which it is not: religion proper, (real) science, rationality, modernity. The result, then, is far from marginal. --Tomoko Masuzawa, University of Michigan","genres":["Politics & Social Sciences","Sermons","Science & Math","Christian Books & Bibles","Alchemy","Occult","Religion & Spirituality","Social Sciences","Magic","Anthropology","Ministry & Evangelism","Cultural"]}

If he occupies some middle ground between radicals and conservatives, it is nevertheless an exciting place to be, and new ideas and new constructions pour forth and are built up in profusion. The scholarship is impeccable.&#x22;--David Noel Freedman, Professor of Hebrew Bible, University of California, San Diego&#x22;These interlocking essays offer a lucid and finely instructive account of how the biblical writers wove together myth, folklore, literary invention, and actual memory to create a national past regarded with the utmost seriousness. Ronald Hendel combines acute philological analysis, informed awareness of the archeological evidence, and an openness to the broader horizons of intellectual and cultural history in a way that is a model of intellectual method.&#x22;--Robert Alter, author ofThe Art of Biblical Narrative&#x22;Ronald Hendel has written a magnificent volume of interlocking essays which discuss Israel's historical memories. His book should make a major impact on the field of biblical studies. His perceptions of the evolution of Israel's ethnic identity and religion neglect neither its cultural lore held in common with its neighbors, nor the distinctive traits which emerge, especially in Israel's perception of its history as defining its origins as a distinct nation, and furnishing the ground of its religion.&#x22;--Frank Moore Cross, Hancock Professor of Hebrew and Other Oriental Languages, Emeritus, Harvard University","genres":["Sacred Writings","Old Testament","Christian Books & Bibles","History","World","Bible Study & Reference","Reference","Religion & Spirituality","History of Religion","More Translations","Biography","Hebrew Bible (Old Testament)","Religious","Bibles","Criticism & Interpretation","Judaism","Biographies"]}

As the subtitle promises, it is the story of a vocation, and as any complete story of a vocation must be, it is the story of the time in which the vocation was formed. Merton was already one of the most influential spiritual writers of the twentieth century when he died unexpectedly in 1968, and in the more than 25 years since, his influence has continued to grow. This collection is a fascinating personal glimpse into the intellectual and spiritual sources of that influence. Moments of brilliance are intertwined with ordinariness lifted to extraordinary heights by increasingly disciplined reflection. The book will be of particular interest not only to those who seek a greater understanding of Merton, but also to those who seek a greater understanding of spiritual development and the spiritual dimensions of the political developments of this troubled century.Steve Schroeder","price":{"$numberDouble":"0.99"},"imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HsfjxNwCL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg","related":{"also_bought":["B000UVBT7C","B003P2VJVO","B000U913PC","B000U913P2","B003JBI3A6","B0085TK8MS","B000UVBT6I","B00FOANDMI","B00EEW2ZUS","B001AW2OXS","B00EE1YB2O","B003WJQ5XM","B007PKQ2GE","B007PKRK0G","B002VD6NJ6","B00AYXMJVQ","B000VYX8ZY","B00I1M4HLC","B00IMROX88","B00395ZYV8","B0099JRE3O","B003MC5IL4","B003WJQ62W","B008QY1K6A","B00IAG5HQ8","B0046A9RU4","B00I8TE2L8","B00KYBSUUM","B00JFDMIMQ","B000U913KM","B004YTPAP8","B007Y7KZE8","B00HT9AJDS","B009OK1VE6","B003TWNDXW","B00DB3D7SA","B00DHZKCSA","B00I8QAKSK","B00BNMX7AY","B00DJUA972","B00IA83ZDI","B00AVL5UC6","B00BZHBO02","B000W9669I","B00IPWTP60","B001DF4SFY","B00IS80WT0","B008O7MQBW","B0020Q3FK4","B000W914D6","B00DKDXAE2","B00BUEKM2G","B008SIT1P6","B003KGBNBG","B003EO8T84","B002URBQEK","B002VM7G2K","B00DP7HXXC","B00HSSRNJS","B005ZK94FW","B003MC5IF0","B0030ZRZCI","B005DTKO4A","B00917PJRC","B00ITZRRZY","B00I9KUTHW","B00EPL90BU","B00ALKPW4S","B004N625K0","B0058C6QJY","B00I50EXNW","B002JM2C4E","B00B7AW1MW","B00FIP6IXA","B00IQZHK8G","B00H0IFXZ2","B00FI7JT1Q","B001P9O32Q","B00H5XTG82","B003TFE58Q","B00DL18FP2","B003ZHVEHI","B0072V4BE6","B001NLKXU2","B004TLVNGQ","B00B62F3VM","B00K2ZRWIQ","B003NSC5IG","B000SEGJXU","B003J359J2","B00BE7XCUS","B003MC5INC","B001DDLTIU","B00EE1YB7E","B00GTXPXEU","B00J8TVIVE","B00ATFFVMS","B003NHRRNA","B000FC123M"],"buy_after_viewing":["B000UVBT7C","B0085TK8MS","B00EEW2ZUS","B003P2VJVO"]},"categories":[["Books","Biographies & Memoirs","Leaders & Notable People","Religious"],["Books","Politics & Social Sciences","Philosophy","Religious"],["Books","Religion & Spirituality","Spirituality"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Biographies & Memoirs","Leaders & Notable People","Religious"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Politics & Social Sciences","Philosophy","Religious"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Religion & Spirituality","Spirituality","Inspirational","Biography"]],"genres":["Politics & Social Sciences","Spirituality","Inspirational","Biography","Biographies & Memoirs","Religion & Spirituality","Religious","Philosophy","Leaders & Notable People"]}

They have HOT, arousing sex (I was certainly aroused!) and begin to fall in love. There are a number of secondary characters, including Teri's amazing mother.

In such a study, establishing the relevancy of the individual is more difficult in many ways.

That she succeeds so admirably in her endeavor is a tribute not only to her research skills, but also to her ability to portray her findings to the reader in a lucid and captivating manner....This is an excellent book and should seve as the foundation for any secondary research on Jean Lannes for the Foreseeble future.?-Army History","genres":["Historical","Strategy","History","France","Biographies & Memoirs","Europe","Military"]}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfecbc2b19a853d963d69"},"asin":"B000UH5Z4Y","description":"In life there are moments of pure bliss and moments of utter despair. The day Jasmine St. Clair realized her biggest dream, she experienced both.That day, from sunrise till sunset it rained, making the August day in Los Angeles abnormally cool. The wet weather hadn't bothered her at first, not like it usually did. Jasmine had been in a giddy state of elation, the rush of delicious emotions so strong as she anticipated the coming evening that she'd hardly noticed the summer shower. Hours before the hairstylist and makeup artist arrived&#151;two of the best in the business&#151;her mind had danced with thoughts of how extraordinarily beautiful she would look at the gala event, how incredible she would feel. But when by late afternoon the sky grew darker and more bleak with heavier rain, Jasmine took notice, her excitement quickly fading. Instantly her skin prickled as she felt the familiar chill take hold of the base of her neck, slowly creeping across her shoulder blades and down her spine. But before it could totally overpower her and take her to that dark, cold place, she fought the chill with three shots of brandy and thoughts of her mother. Her mother believed that rain was a blessing. Despite the fact that it rained the day her younger brother had been killed in a senseless hit-and-run incident and didn't stop raining until after his funeral, her mother still believed that. Today, the most important day of her life thus far, Jasmine needed to believe it, too.But if Jasmine had been looking for a sign that her success would be short-lived, the rain should have been it. With the rain normally came an inexplicable feeling of cold so deep inside nothing could warm her. The cold could last for hours or even days, until something ultimately went wrong in her life. Something major, like when her brother died. Or something minor, like when her fingernail caught in her car door and completely tore off.Jasmine had moved from Florida to California to escape frequent showers, and today she refused to see the weather as a bad omen. Today, sheknew,was different. Not even the unexpected downpour could dampen her sweet mood.This was why, as she followed her boyfriend into the lavishly decorated penthouse suite later that evening, a glass of champagne already in hand, Jasmine felt a rush of excitement. Like a woman thrown into a time warp she was in awe, examining everything around her with the interest of someone seeing it for the first time. Her eyes surveyed the mahogany-hardwood floor partially covered by a giant Persian rug, the gold and crystal chandelier in the center of the room, the textured cream-and-rosecolored wallpaper, the French Provincial furniture and Victorian era paintings. It was all so incredible. And it was all, for one night, hers.Jasmine's cell phone vibrated in her palm. She glanced at the screen and saw her agent's number, and decided to ignore it. She wanted nothing to interrupt her emotional high, not even another congratulatory call from the woman who'd booked her the audition that had landed her this major film role.As Jasmine continued walking into the suite, she was aware of sounds around her, but they were drowned out by the intense pounding of her heart. Mesmerized, she took tentative steps toward the floorto-ceiling window, placing her fingertips on the cool glass as she scanned the wide expanse of the city. Rain trickled down the glass like teardrops. She traced the path of one raindrop, suddenly wondering if it was a tear of joy or sadness.It's just rain,she thought, quickly halting the direction of her thoughts. It wasn't a blessing or a curse; it was just an evening shower.That decided, Jasmine saw past the rain, enjoying the view of the city below. Had she ever been this high before? Thirty-five stories up, the world below seemed abstract, like a different planet. An infinitely friendlier, more attractive place. Certainly not the Los Angeles she knew, where people smiled to your face while they stabbed you in the chest. This world seemed like one she could control, like her own personal playground.And in the night, the glittering streetlights below looked like a carpet of stars. Stars laid out just for her.The corners of her lips twitched, wanting to smile, and as Jasmine splayed her free hand on the window, she finally released the scream she'd held inside for hours. The carpet of starswasfor her&#151;to walk on, sit on, roll around on. Because tonight, this high in the sky, she was literally on top of the world. She had made it! Conquered the dream she'd once believed  else's. She was the queen of the universe.Downing a liberal gulp of champagne, Jasmine smiled, laughter bubbling from her throat like the tiny bubbles floating to the surface of the champagne. God, this feeling of success was so incredible she could savor it for days and days. She'd done it&#151; she had reached a point in her career where she could go nowhere but up. The options were boundless now, as limitless as the stars in the sky. She had dreamed of this day since she was a child, had practiced the appreciative wave for her fans, had strutted the seductive, actress walk. She even had her Oscar award-winning speech memorized. Though tonight she hadn't needed it, she knew one day she would.Her life was as wonderful as she'd always known it could be. It had taken thirty-one years, but finally she had achieved her ultimate goal.She was now a verified movie star.Jasmine, what a fabulous performance! You are destined for super stardom!Ms. St. Clair, please, your autograph?Jasmine, over here. Just one quick picture&#133;The lights had flashed around her all night; the buzz had surrounded her wherever she walked; she had been the center of attention, sometimes so crowded by fans and industry people that she hadn't been able to move. But she hadn't minded. It was her life's ambition to be surrounded with love, to knowSome people craved money, and yes, money came with a successful acting career, but that wasn't what it was about for Jasmine. She just wanted to know that she would never go back to that lonely place. And now, she wouldn't. That lonely place of her childhood was finally locked away, forever hidden in a dark corner of her past.Glancing heavenward, she wondered what her brother would think of her now, of how far she had come. Her gaze fixing on a star brighter than the rest, Jasmine imagined that it was her brother, Rickey's, star, that he was smiling down at her, happy that she'd finally gotten out of life what she wanted. When he was alive, she had been happy. Her whole family had been. But after his death, her parents had become so lost in their despair that life in the St. Clair household had changed drastically and permanently. Jasmine's parents hadn't been there for her the way she'd needed them to be. They hadn't been able to smile at her achievements without remembering Rickey and what should have been. They hadn't been able to smile, period. The grief had been overwhelming, and unlike most families that found a way to go on after tragedy, Jasmine's parents hadn't been able to do that. Jasmine had lost Rickey physically that day, but she'd emotionally lost her parents.Her parents&#133; Jasmine felt only a moment's regret that she hadn't invited her mother and father to the screening, easing her conscience by telling herself that they were so far removed from Hollywood life that a shindig like this one would bore them. Besides, they wouldn't know what to say to people. The troubled world of Miami's north side was a far cry from the glamour and glitz of Hollywood. Her father would no doubt embarrass her with talk of what she'd been like as a child, how she'd been so poor she'd had to wear hand-me-down shoes a size too small. Her mother, sweet but clueless, would have gawked at the likes of Denzel Washington and Brad Pitt, surely humiliating her.But the truth was, Jasmine feared that if her parents had been at the screening of her first blockbuster film, the memory of their missing son would have ultimately depressed them, and as a result, depressed her. And that wasn't something she'd wanted on such an important night.No, she'd done the right thing by not inviting them. &#x22;Come here.&#x22;Startled, Jasmine giggled as Allan's firm hands circled her waist from behind, pulling her buttocks against his arousal. Champagne spilled from the crystal flute as she gained her balance, settling against him. All thoughts of guilt fled her mind. &#x22;Allan&#133;&#x22;His tongue found her ear, gently licking the lobe the way one would lick honey from a rose petal. Jasmine closed her eyes, gripped his thigh&#133;and wondered why she wasn't getting turned on. Her ear was a definite erogenous zone, but as she opened her eyes, she realized that his tongue wouldn't do the job because her mind wouldn't let it.She wasn't ready. &#x22;Damn, Jasmine, you taste so good. You feel so good. Come to the bedroom.&#x22;&#x22;Not yet,&#x22; she replied, then sipped more champagne, hoping it would relieve the sudden annoyance she felt at Allan's impatience, his one-track mind. Recently he'd been cutting short the foreplay and going straight for the main event. He always wanted her in his bed, and yes, he was a great lover, but didn't he realize that she wanted to enjoy this feeling for as long as she could? That not even an orgasm could be better than the natural high she felt right now?Jasmine heard the faint sound of her cell phone vibrating, and while she hadn't wanted to answer it before, she reached into her purse and pulled it out.

His startling theory holds that the world's religions are best understood as &#x22;systematic anthropomorphism,&#x22; arising from the universal tendency to ascribe human characteristics to God and gods, to nature, animals, the weather and daily occurrences. People anthropomorphize, he maintains, because they perceive the world in terms of their own interests. Through the perceptual strategy of animism, they attribute life to objects and events, conjuring a panoply of spirit beings, according to Guthrie's schema. As for Buddhism and other creeds with no deities, Guthrie maintains that they are not religions but, rather, ethical or psychological systems. He scrutinizes anthropomorphism in the visual arts and philosophy, drawing on cognitive science, ethnography and psychology to buttress his often debatable points. His theory complements and revises theories that interpret religion as social glue, wish-fulfillment, primitive science or means of interaction with sacred and spiritual realms.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dcbfeccc2b19a853d963d71"},"asin":"B000UKON3K","description":"In this first hardcover edition of a 1968 paperback original (titled Two for Tanner), Evan Tanner is &#x22;the spy who never sleeps,&#x22; a Korean War vet whose head injury has destroyed the sleep center in his brain. Never having to sleep, Tanner has plenty of time to become interested in hopeless causes, help oppressed groups, learn obscure languages and travel to exotic locales. The U.S. government has used his undercover talents in the past, but in this fourth novel in the Tanner series he's working for himself. Missing in Thailand is his latest girlfriend, singer Tuppence Ngawa, who is half African and half American and speaks in a bizarre '60s jive. Tuppence and the jazz musicians with whom she was on tour have been kidnapped by Communist rebels, shortly after a major burglary of the Thai royal jewelry collection. Tanner rushes to Tuppence's rescue, only to be taken prisoner by another rebel group in the dense Thai jungle. Tanner escapes from a bamboo cage perched in a tree with the help of a small, comical Thai who believes that somehow Tanner can help him finally find a woman who will relieve him of his virginity. This early Block novel is very much of its time, very '60s, with eerie echoes of the treatment of American POWs in Vietnam. It's still a great pleasure today.

Also, as stated, the book introduces methods of data analysis in geosciences using MATLAB. I purchased the book for the &#x22;applications in geosciences&#x22; part and not the &#x22;MATLAB&#x22; part. I have nothing, in particular, against using MATLAB, but I choose to use Python. Python is free, and I (and many, many others) believe it to provide more manageable and powerful numerical analysis capabilities as well as better overall peripheral integration (integrating with other programming languages, applications, OS systems, or other platform specifics). The nice thing about the book is that the MATLAB code snippets and brief implementation explanations, can be easily translated into python implementation. If you are tied to MATLAB, I don't think you will be disappointed. If you have some familiarity with python then you will also be able to glean allot from the content. Another reason that I enjoy this book, is that while it relies on quite a bit of advanced math and its application, it uses the math as an 'engineering type' book should - as a tool to use to solve a problem. The mathematical element flows nicely with the subject matter and I suspect that even an individual without a mathematics background could gain an appreciation for the math based on the context and would not necessarily need to know or learn every underlying aspect of theory that generated the mathematics used. This is refreshing to see in an advanced book - here is what you might be up against, here is what you need to get the job done.","categories":[["Books","Science & Math","Earth Sciences","Geology"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Professional Science","Earth Sciences","Geology"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Science & Math","Earth Sciences","Geology"]],"genres":["Earth Sciences","Science & Math","Professional Science","Professional & Technical","Geology"]}

[this book] makes its own unique contribution by exploring diverse issues related to the social capital idea.&#x22;   International Journal of Social Welfare&#x22;Social Capital is a magisterial analysis of how social networks are a key to individual achievement and social inclusion. Nan Lin shows that those who depend only on market transactions ignore at their peril the social relationships that underlie and shape deals. Those who read this book will increase their human capital by learning how to increase their social capital.&#x22;    Barry Wellman, University of Toronto&#x22;This long-needed and richly detailed volume, by one of the original theorists of social capital, organizes and advances on the key intellectual challenges and accomplishments of the field of structural sociology. Immensely readable and relevant to today's most interesting sociological questions regarding economic life, Lin's book succeeds in bursting open new doors to the theoretically and substantively important consequences of social capital.&#x22;    Brian Uzzi, Northwestern University&#x22;In Social Capital Nan Lin takes on the long overdue task of meshing incoming network theory with social stratification and mobility theory - in both cases with guidance from empirical research. Aptly, Lin demonstrates the 'strength of weak models': by avoiding technical specifications he not only makes the book accessible to the non-numerate but also suggests how his themes can bear on different disciplinary interests and venues.&#x22;    Harrison White, Columbia University&#x22;Social Capital integrates Nan Lin's two decades of work on social resources and instrumental action. It carefully distinguishes the capital residing in social networks from economic, human, and cultural capital. Drawing on his original research in both the United States and East Asia, Lin presents compelling empirical evidence showing provocative theoretical extensions about the role of social capital in the formation of both networks and reputations, and argues that developments in information techmology have led to a dramatic rise in the formation of social capital.&#x22;    Peter V.

This book introduces &#x22;security externalities&#x22;, a phenomenon that inhibits private investments that would make critical infrastructure services more resilient to potential disaster from anysource. It calls not only for more leadership but for more realistic policies from both the private and the public sector.&#148;Prof. Thomas C.

The response to this millennium challenge can only be found in our capacity to demonstrate innovative collaboration, effective leadership, and courage.

Daisy and her husband, Scotland Yard's DCI Alec Fletcher, team up to unmask the killer. Daisy does all the really clever sleuthing, but she kindly allows her hubby to think he's putting things together himself. Things get tricky when one of the chief suspects, who may also be a blackmailer, disappears. And then there's the curious matter of the manner of death: the autopsy concludes that the Yeoman Warder died of a broken neck, so why was there also a partizan, or Yeoman Warder's halberd, sticking out of his back? Appropriate historical detail and witty dialogue are the finishing touches on this engaging 1920s period piece.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When he searches for his own name on a dating Web site and finds 20-something Maya, whose ad reads &#x22;Write like Prem Rustum, think like Prem Rustum... be Prem Rustum,&#x22; he seizes the chance and follows her from New York to Paris, where she has a writing fellowship. Both of them draw great pleasure and creative power from the long seduction that follows, and over the course of the book Dawesar (Babyji) shows off her own superior dirty-bit skills in plenty of sex scenes and daydreams. She also firmly entwines readers in Prem and Maya's family lives and creative meditations. The breezy tempo of Dawesar's assured prose belies the gravitas of her subject, conveyed through believable dialogue between people who are serious about art, ideas, reading and writing.(June 20)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For example, the new generation of semiconductor inspection systems is being pushed to image at increasingly shorter DUV wavelengths to facilitate inspection of deep sub-micron features in integrated circuits. DUV-sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras are in demand for these applications. Although CCD cameras that are responsive at DUV wavelengths are now available, their long-term stability is still a major concern. This book describes the degradation mechanisms and long-term performance of CCDs in the DUV, along with new results of device performance at these wavelengths.","categories":[["Books","Engineering & Transportation","Engineering","Computer Modelling","Imaging Systems"],["Books","Engineering & Transportation","Engineering","Electrical & Electronics","Electronics","Microelectronics"],["Books","Engineering & Transportation","Engineering","Materials & Material Science","Extraction & Processing"],["Books","Science & Math","Physics","Optics"],["Books","Science & Math","Technology"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Engineering","Electrical & Electronics","Electricity Principles"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Engineering","Electrical & Electronics","Electronics","Microelectronics"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Engineering","Electrical & Electronics","Optics"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Engineering","Materials Science"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Professional Science","Physics","Light"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Professional & Technical","Professional Science","Physics","Optics"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Science & Math","Physics","Light"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Science & Math","Physics","Optics"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Science & Math","Technology","General & Reference"]],"genres":["Materials Science","Electronics","Professional Science","Computer Modelling","Professional & Technical","Optics","Electricity Principles","Materials & Material Science","Imaging Systems","General & Reference","Microelectronics","Engineering","Physics","Light","Science & Math","Extraction & Processing","Technology","Engineering & Transportation","Electrical & Electronics"]}

The book summarizes both the history and our present understanding of this field, so as to provide a solid foundation for graduate students, current researchers and interested scientists in related fields. The book is easy to read, well written, and hard to put down. . . .The two most important problems examined by the book concern the presence of sign reversals in the observed correlations and the fact that the climate variations that are observed are larger by a factor of ten than simple energy-balance calculations can account for. The book reviews the possible explanations for these problems and is quite successful in giving the reader a well-balanced picture of the field.&#x22;--Physics Today&#x22;Douglas Hoyt and Kenneth Schatten point out that the large numbers of sunspots during the 11th and 12th centuries made Earth significantly warmer, allowing Vikings to settle in Greenland, for example. The authors review many historical studies of the Sun's influence on climate.

In three parts, the authors present material on solar activity, development of humankind's understanding of the sun, and the sun's variations; the sun-climate connection, particularly on the 11-year timescale; and possible alternative explanations for variations. Throughout the book, the authors pose the question `Does the sun affect the climate?' and present evidence to support and to discount the theory.&#x22; --Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society&#x22;Hoyt and Schatten's book is a fascinating and well written history of this interesting chapter of science that is relevant to the understanding of the earth system on one hand and to the increasingly fierce battle between conservationists and industrialists concerning global warming, on the other.

Magee, an associate musicology professor at Indiana University, attempts to redress this slight in his scholarly look at the work of Fletcher Henderson (1897&#x2013;1952). More a &#x22;portrait of a musical collaboration&#x22; than a biography, Magee's narrative travels from Henderson's years as a bandleader during the Harlem Renaissance through his stint as Benny Goodman's arranger, highlighting the musical idiosyncrasies of what became known as &#x22;Hendersonese.&#x22; Magee paints a vivid portrait of the central figures of early jazz and swing (Louis Armstrong is a &#x22;strong streak of color in a crazy quilt&#x22;) as well as the business of recording and touring in the 1920s and '30s. While Benny Goodman is lauded as the major force behind the Big Band sound, Magee argues convincingly that Henderson was equally important in &#x22;building the kingdom of swing.&#x22; The layperson will struggle with the musical notation and terminology, as well as the repetitious readings of dozens of scores and performances. For the jazz student, though, Magee's analysis of Henderson's recordings will be invaluable, as will the appendix annotating every arrangement Henderson wrote for Goodman. This may not be the book that brings Henderson out of the shadows, but it's a welcome addition to the study of swing.

In this thorough, often gripping study, Kinsella, a former Los Angeles Herald-Examiner editor, shows how the media and medical experts fumbled the AIDS story. Randy Shilts, the gay San Francisco reporter who wrote And the Band Played On , is portrayed as an ambitious news-hound who sometimes overdramatized or misreported information.

Most Americans-96 percent, to be exact- are somehow involved in the arts, whether as audience participants, hobbyists, or via broadcast recording, video, or the Internet. The contribution of the arts to the U.S. economy is stunning: the nonprofit arts industry alone contributes over 857 billion dollars per year, and American artists enjoy world-class status.Despite its size, quality, and economic impact, the arts community is not articulate about how to serve the public interest, and few citizens have an appreciation of the many public policies that influence American arts and culture. The contributors to this volume argue that U.S. policy does and should continue to support the arts; as they sere a broad, not merely an elite, public. Support for the arts and culture is good economic and trade policy and contributes to the quality of life and community, while it sustains the creativity of American artists and organizations.Contents: - Mapping the Public Life of the Arts in America, Joni M.

Aidan. Baz. Ryan. A functional, happy foursome that lives, laughs, works, and plays together. So what happens when they find themselves attracted to Nicholas, who would make them five instead of four?They make room, of course.Big Enough for Five is the story of five men, different as different can be, drawn together by their love for each other and the small publishing company that binds them. From Baz's playfulness to Aidan's quiet humor, from Nicholas's love for anything to do with books to Marcus's rigid stubbornness, and then Ryan, who has easy tolerance and patience for them all, these men are not to be forgotten.Willa Okati does a truly amazing job of winding these men and their lives together, showing how they affect and are affected by their partners and the others who work with them. I was truly captivated by the descriptions of their personalities and how they managed to shift from four men to five with barely a ripple in their relationship.Not to say, however, that their road always runs smooth. One of the many reasons I loved this story so much was the way Willa illustrates the difficulties the men have when there are five different voices that need different things, both emotionally and sexually. Their problems are real, their solutions are heartwarming and believable, and by the last page, I was a little in love with all five of them.Electrically charged sex scenes and snappy dialogue made this book a compelling, erotic read and added to my overall enjoyment. Big Enough for Five definitely goes on my recommended reading list and has earned a permanent place on my shelf.","categories":[["Books","Gay & Lesbian","Literature & Fiction","Fiction","Gay"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction","Gay & Lesbian","Gay"],["Kindle Store","Kindle eBooks","Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction","Gay & Lesbian","Lesbian"]],"genres":["Genre Fiction","Gay","Lesbian","Fiction","Literature & Fiction","Gay & Lesbian"]}

Kennedy, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, use the same techniques here for an oral biography of Tibet's famous spiritual leader. They begin by offering brief profiles of the 54 interviewees, ranging from Western Buddhist VIPs like Robert Thurman, Jeffrey Hopkins and Lama Surya Das (an American convert from Judaism) to Tibetan lamas and monks, including Venerable Lama Thubten Zoba Rinpoche and Lama Lobsang Thamcho Nyima. (Refreshingly, this volume doesn't pander to Hollywood celebrities; Richard Gere is the only famous entertainer interviewed, and he has some genuinely insightful things to say.) The authors arrange the interviewees' snippets thematically, beginning with the lama's basic appeal and personal character before moving through his life chronologically, starting with his recognition as the Dalai Lama at the age of three. (About this, Thurman makes the helpful analogy that it's not only that the lamas are expected to be child prodigies and &#x22;little Mozarts,&#x22; but also that they're believed to have &#x22;already written a million symphonies in ten previous lives.&#x22;) The interviews then cover Chinese occupation and the exile to India, and the Dalai Lama's gradual rise to international fame. Some of the stories are humorous and light, while others are profoundly moving and personal. One of the great strengths of this book is that the interviewees are allowed to discuss the Tibetan political situation at some length, and to speculate on Tibet's evolving relationship with the Chinese government.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The authors&#x97;two write/edit online for a sports Web site, the third is a banker (!)&#x97;have pulled together a grab bag of intriguing, well-researched sports topics. There's the all-rotund pitching staff, which includes Mickey Lolich and Fernando Valenzuela. There's the list of franchise-killing losses, including the 1992 seventh-game Braves victory over the Pirates, who haven't recovered since. The list of worst trades, including Boston's Jeff Bagwell for Houston's Larry Anderson, and, of course, Brock for Broglio. And the list of the worst of grotesque injuries&#x97;don't ask. The Overrated section alone, which includes Joe Namath's career, Notre Dame football, and U.S.A. World Cup soccer, is enough to propel sports geeks through this book in a sitting or two.

Aimed at readers worried about snooping by entities ranging from the government to marketers, Holtzman plainly outlines what he calls the &#x22;seven sins against privacy&#x22; under which most violations can be categorized. He details the trails we all leave behind us that are increasingly finding their way into commercial and government databases. The book is divided into five sections: damage resulting from the loss of privacy, a historical overview, the legal basis of privacy, the mechanics behind snooping, and how to protect privacy. Holtzman includes samples of stories from newspapers and magazines of privacy violations, as well as an overview of the gadgets that trace our every movement, from cell phones to global positioning systems, police surveillance cameras, and chips that can be hidden in books and clothing. Advocating for a balance between security and privacy, Holtzman warns that &#x22;data never disappears.&#x22;Vanessa BushCopyright &#169; American Library Association.
