13,B000FA64PK,"[0, 0]",3,"Troy Denning's novella Recovery was originally published in e-book form and is a short tale set after the events of Kathy Tyers' Balance Point. Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.We start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.In fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.Certainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters.","03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Han and Leia reunited and Barabel Jedi introduced,1331769600

21,B000FA64QO,"[0, 0]",2,"With Ylesia, a novella originally published in e-book form, Walter Jon Williams gets an opportunity to insert further story into his novel Destiny's Way. The events of Ylesia take place midway through that book, so this is a good read to tackle immediately after finishing Destiny's Way. The novella follows a New Republic mission to the titular planet, which is serving as the capital of the traitorous Peace Brigade and houses their attempt at a Senate. The Peace Brigade promote capitulation to the Yuuzhan Vong and have served as a human counterpoint to the efforts of the Jedi and the more heroic members of the New Republic throughout the New Jedi Order. They are a logical part of the story but not one I've found terribly interesting, as we rarely get anything told from their point-of-view, making them rather cardboard as adversaries.Yleisa brings back Thracken Sal-Solo in an entertaining plotline which sees him forcibly installed as the President of the Peace Brigade. This doesn't fit well with Sal-Solo's plans to better his own galactic situation but he displays a knack for adaption and survival not unlike that of his famous cousin Han Solo. Ylesia itself, a major source of the drug spice in the Star Wars galaxy, will be familiar to readers of A. C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy, and it's nice to see it return.For the most part Yleisa doesn't advance the story of Destiny's Way much: primarily, it delivers some closure to the Peace Brigade subplot. Sal-Solo was the most memorable aspect, as some of the space battle and ground assault material following the New Republic's invasion of the system felt like material I've read an awful lot of times before.  Ylesia is a solid enough little story but I would only recommend it to someone going through the entire New Jedi Order and wanting a little more.","03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Minor New Jedi Order side story,1331769600

However, the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel, but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 14), which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel, so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises.","05 17, 2011",AQZH7YTWQPOBE,Enjolras,A Thrackan story,1305590400

27,B000FBFMVG,"[5, 5]",3,"Originally published as an e-book coinciding with the release of the novel Tatooine Ghost, Troy Denning's A Forest Apart is a short story following Chewbacca, his wife Mallatobuck, and his son Lumpy on a adventure into the bowels of Coruscant. Malla and Lumpy are visiting Chewie at his Coruscant apartment when a break-in at the next-door Solo place turns out to have more serious ramifications. The Wookiees follow the burglars and end up unearthing an Imperial plot set in place by an old tool of the villainous Ysanne Isard.There's a lot of action in a short space but not much time for meaningful character development. Lumpy is a pre-teen striving to find his place in the world, and Chewbacca's perpetual absence in his life may have left a gaping hole as far as having a father figure to look up to. There's not enough pages to explore this theme with much depth, and in the end the issue is dropped, since on a practical level Lumpy can't live with his father chasing all over the galaxy anyway. The theme of the impact a Wookiee Life Debt has on the Wookiee holding it and on his/her family is an interesting one that could be explored in more detail with a longer story.Unlike many novels which handle Chewie's communications by having him grunt and then having a nearby character paraphrase what he said, Denning makes the wise choice of letting the Wookiees speak as normal characters and simply puts brackets to indicate they are actually using their native tongue. It's always enjoyable seeing Chewbacca in action, and even though this story doesn't really add anything significant to the larger saga, it's an entertaining diversion.","08 25, 2008",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Short story featuring everyone's favorite Wookiee,1219622400

This book ""A Forest Apart"" wasn't on par with his other works.  It wasn't without it's charm, but it had things in it that I didn't like.The story itself is pretty simple.  It's a coming of age story for Chewbacca's son, and instead of coming of age on Kashyyyk, he is growing up on Coruscant.  It's not horrible, and we find out that Lumpy is an avid gamer and enjoys playing video games and that he idolizes his father.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***First of all, why is Han Solo on the cover?  He's not even IN this story other than a few mentions of his name.  Why not have Chewbacca and Lumpy instead of Han and Chewie?  Also, I HATE books where Chewbacca's grunts and growls are translated.  Like in the Black Fleet Trilogy, he had his speech translated and it was just stupid.  I feel that he works much better as a strong silent type who speaks through his actions rather than his words.  I mean imagine in characters like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Silent Bob, or Sphynx (from Gone in 60 Seconds), all just started having lengthy conversations throughout their movies?  They lose some of what makes those characters awesome.  Sometimes an author can say very much by having a character say very little.My only other problem with the book is when Chewie and Malla have the droid ""IT"" in their blaster sights, his back is to them and he doesn't see them.  Why don't they just shoot him?  Instead they send Lumpy out as a ""distraction.""  Yet he doesn't really do anything worth mentioning to distract IT and his minions.  He walks out on the observation deck where they are hiding, opens the window and drops down to the level where IT and his minions are loading nerve gas onto transport ships.  I mean that's not much of a distraction, besides the point of a distraction is to get someone's attention away from one spot so you can do something while they are not looking.  Well, IT wasn't looking in your direction to begin with, so why bother?  They could have just taken up positions on the observation deck and shot him.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Okay so this story wasn't really bad other than a few minor details I didn't like.

35,B000FC1BN8,"[1, 1]",3,"Timothy Zahn's Fool's Bargain is a short story originally published in e-book form and set before the events of his novel Survivor's Quest. This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie ""left-handed,"" vs. a truth which is ""right-handed"" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance. It can be purchased in electronic form and is also available in the paperback version ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars).","09 24, 2010",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Enjoyable Imperial slice-of-life story,1285286400

42,B000FC1BN8,"[0, 0]",2,"I admit it, I snapped this up the moment I saw it on new releases, because I tend to do that with anything written by Timothy Zahn. He is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary sci-fi authors where it comes to world building, intricate plot, and edge-of-seat action. His Thrawn and Conqueror's trilogies were incredible, Quadrail and Cobra were very unique and engaging, and even his one-off novels like Icarus Hunt and Outbound Flight are excellent. So I figured this would be too.First off, when I hit the end my jaw dropped and I literally said aloud ""Huh? That's it?!"" I then spent several minutes looking to see if it picked up somewhere else. It is a really short story, barely longer than some of the ones that appear in the 'Tales' Star Wars series (and those books have several of them!). It's also, I must say, a lot less interesting than most of them and probably the single weakest plot I've seen Zahn write. It's not terrible, but it really isn't that great either- there's no twists and at the end you're left wondering where the other half of the story is. The novella revolves around a force of Stormtroopers who are only somewhat memorable (as is the case with most such white-armored shock troops) and though there is quite a bit of action, it kind of reads like a (short) movie or videogame script.Overall, not worth paying for. In fact, it should really be free if you ask me.","01 17, 2013",A1YEPFLLH42OU1,"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia ""Yu-Jin Chia""",An average short story,1358380800
43,B000FC1BN8,"[0, 0]",5,"I love Timothy Zahn's work!  He does what no other writer, not even George Lucas himself can do.  He takes the rank and file Storm Troopers and gives them personalities, talents, skills and makes them multi-dimensional characters that people can get invested in.Where most writers show the Storm Troopers as faceless cannon fodder who can't hit anything with their blasters, Zahn shows them as competent sharpshooting elite commandos who can think on their feet and adapt to any situation as well as follow orders.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***So the story is a pretty basic one.  There is an alien warlord who is ruling a planet with an iron fist, and the Empire decides it is time to go and free the plant of his rule, so they dispatch the 501st Legion a.k.a. Vader's Fist to take him down.There is something I do wonder about though, this takes place after Vader is dead, and after Thrawn's rule has ended.  So why does the 501st Legion keep calling themselves ""Vader's Fist?""  Vader's not around anymore?  Do they keep the name just for the sake of nostalgia?  It's not really a major gripe, just something that makes me scratch my head.Our main characters are three Storm Troopers who all have different skills and specialties.  They infiltrate the warlord's fortress and meet up with some of the local freedom fighters and strike a deal with them.  If the troopers help them free their imprisoned comrades, they will help the troopers get inside and take out the warlord's troops and bring him to justice.The troopers agree and they infiltrate the stronghold together.  Later it seems the rebels have betrayed the Storm Troopers, but it turns out it is just a very elaborate ruse and the rebels were always on the side of the troopers and the prisoners are freed and the warlord is captured by the Empire and brought to justice.Later the head of the rebels is offered a position in the 501st Legion, which is awesome!  It really helps to enforce the fact that the Empire has learned that just having humans in their military doesn't help, it's a hindrance and it was the main reason the Rebel Alliance was able to defeat them.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Zahn gives us action, gun fights, intrigue and a little bit of politics as well in this story.

Since then I have read several more of L'Amour's books and have enjoyed all of them.  I will review them here over the next few weeks, time permitting.This book tells the story of how a young man from New York City ends up in a small Kansas town and picks up the job of being the Sheriff one day before all hell is scheduled to break loose.

I'm glad I also have the Shambhala book, because some of the typos in this Kindle book make it at times a real head scratcher.  Here are some of the funnier ones:* Through the weakening of the causes of bondage, and by learning the method of sassing, the consciousness is transferred to the other body.* Vestures of consciousness are built up in conformity with the Boston of the feeling of selfhood.* In the internals of the batik, other thoughts will arise, through the impressions of the dynamic mind-images.I'm glad I had the Hartranft version to be able to figure out what was being said.Unlike Hartranft and most modern translators, Johnston takes exception with calling the sutras ""aphorisms"", pointing out that aphorisms are really standalone gems of wisdom, while sutras are interdependent. I kind of agree with that.  But, being an older translation, the word use is a bit quaint.  For example, Johnson likes the word ""psychic"", but more in the sense of psychological, not extrasensory perception.  He uses the phrase ""judicial action"" to connote ""reflection-free"".  He's fond of the word ""unwisdom"", which Hartranft translates as ""not seeing things as they are"".  And he does over-explain sutras that don't need that much explanation to comprehend.  But then, Hartranft goes into great detail also.The lesson to be learned is that, if you're interested in the original philosophy of Yoga and not just the postures, you should read more than one version of this seminal and relatively short book.  Translations are always tricky, so if you compare and contrast different versions from various time periods and interpreters, you'll achieve a better understanding of the original work.","06 21, 2014",A6J7GN6ZOR085,lonebeaut,Compare and contrast for a better understanding,1403308800

L'Amour was a staple when I was growing up, and I still return to him again and again as I go along.  Fair Blows the Wind remains my favorite novel by the author because it's such a combination of Old World swordplay, coming of age, and early Americana.  But that's beside the point.In James Brionne, L'Amour creates one of his best fighting men, a man who'd served in the Union Army during the Civil War, a man who had the ear of President Grant - and a man who had lost his wife to tragic circumstances.  The first few pages of the book draw the reader in and sets him on a journey to see good triumph over evil.The book is much as I remember it, written with a lot of introspection and bouncing around from character to character, with less action and tension than I would have liked.  L'Amour also instills a romantic lyricism in his word choice, though.  James Brionne is an educated man, a thinker, and that shows on the pages.There's no real tension about where the reader is going to get during the read because the endgame is almost transparent.  Still, L'Amour manages to throw a couple curves in there that will leave you unsettled about a few things as you turn the pages.I wish there had been a little more to the story, and even the ending just seems to coast to a halt rather than escalating.  The pieces just fall together without any real stress or narrative tension.The plot is pretty thin even for a L'Amour novel, but the tale pulled me through again, and even though I knew how the book ended, and would have known anyway because it's so clear, I enjoyed roving through the Old West and stepping through my own past.","06 11, 2013",A1U360OMVQRPUB,Mel Odom,Brionne,1370908800

For the most part I've been happy to get my news for free online from a variety of sources, but of late I've been craving a more consistent access to the kind of high quality news stories that WSJ is known for. I decided to check out several subscription options, and compare them to each other. The Kindle version, even though it is very limited in many respects, turns out to be pretty good and in line with my expectations for what I wanted to get out of reading WSJ.Once you subscribe to WSJ, you can setup the delivery to any one of your Kindle devices or enabled Kindle readers. You can also manually download the current issue of WSJ to another device, but the automatic downloads are enabled for only one device at the time (you can change which one in the online Kindle setting at any time). Kindle formatting of WSJ leaves a lot to be desired. As you may imagine, the reading experience will be much closer to reading a book than a newspaper. I don't mind this all that much, as WSJ has always been a pretty text-heavy newspaper. The exceptions are the graphs and charts, which can be almost illegible when presented on Kindle. The sections and articles are well organized and easily accessible through the menu, and I am overall pleased with the navigation options. In terms of formatting, I still prefer the dedicated WSJ iPad version, but the Kindle version gets the job done.One big difference between the Kindle version and those for various tablets is that you won't be able to access various embedded videos on Kindle (not even in the tablet version of Kindle software). Those small video clips are indeed a lot of fun, and definitely add to the overall ""reading"" experience. However, they also add to the size of the download, and unless you have a really fast wireless connection and the latest version of the tablet, the download can be choppy. For me these videos are a nice addition, but they are not crucial.As far as the price goes, yes, Wall Street Journal on Kindle is kind of expensive. However, keep in mind that you can in principle cancel your subscription without much trouble after any number of months has passed, something that in my experience is not that easy to pull off with a print subscription of any newspaper. I do consider WSJ to be a very high quality publication, and in my opinion the price is reasonable for the kind of content and convenience that you get. We've all been spoiled by the years of de-facto free online access to various newspapers and magazines, but unfortunately this free-for-all state of affairs has lead many fine journals and newspapers to shut down.If you are seeking the convenience and the ease of use that the Kindle version of WSJ provides, and are not too concerned with the formatting and various bells and whistles, then I'd definitely recommend that you check it out. So far I've been more satisfied than I had expected based on all the negative reviews that I have read.","03 3, 2012",A36K2N527TXXJN,Dr. Bojan Tunguz,"Convenient, Simply-formatted, Pricey",1330732800

First of all, I had one hell of a time getting it to open on the Kindle Fire.  After much fumbling, I managed.  There are some serious problems with the app: the type face sizes are too small (hardly larger than the print version) and now I can't get it to open on the iPad.  I could have continued with the online version on the iPad and Kindle (I'm going to start receiving the print version soon, I hope) cheaper - but opted for the Amazon version thinking mistakenly that I would be able to read it on the ipad with the larger screen.

After a cordial conversation with Amazon, I cancelled the order - the Amazon print version is nearly 50% more than the same offer from the WSJ.  I then bought the WSJ on line, logged in on my Kindle and presto - a decent readable product (type size is still too small) on line.

No, special white paint from government labs! It turns out any old white paint will do, that a government program is not necesaary, but the NYT did not say so. Irresponsible. In the area of health reporting, Pope wrote a silly article about a Dr. Kesler's book about food. She did not mention that, as head of the FDA, he was engaged in running battles with vitamin and food manufacturers for years. Many of these battles he lost in the courts, which is now why we can use aspirin for heart treatment, which is just as good as the expensive biotech drugs the FDA was touting. Uncritical and irresponsible reporting. A dereliction of the journalist's duty.And what about the economists like Krugman who don't have a clue about how to save the nation's economy. Yet they pontificate in those pages.If you are a times reader, i encourage you to find better sources.Later...To continue this rant, I posted a comment on the NYT website in response to an article.

93,B000GFK7L6,"[7, 8]",3,"When I first got my Kindle, one of the first things I did was take advantage of the 30 trial and subscribe to the NYT. At that time I think the monthly rate was either 11 something or 13 something. The novelty of it was great at first. Seriously, the only thing that makes a person feel spoiled about waking is a newspaper delivered right to your bedside is a butler and breakfast in bed, or so I imagine. It didn't particularly bother me about the features missing because the price was good and the convenience was amazing. In the middle of nowhere, it was feasible to get most, if not all, of the news that's fit to print. Good deal.The paper is usually a delight, but here's where the practical came in. I ended up falling into a pattern of not reading it every day, and what was initially perfectly fine. The subscription was a bargain. The paper was there on the days I wanted it. When they announced the subscription hike, I knew it wasn't for me, because it made it feel wasteful, it made me feel guilty to think of not reading it daily. Once something I read in my leisure time feels like an obligation... In my case, and your needs might be quite different, the folks at the paper priced it right off my Kindle -- except by invitation.There are still periodicals I do subscribe to, like Time and Newsweek, blogs like Slate, and  a few others where the prices are in a range that I don't feel horrible if I skip an issue. With newspapers, however, I prefer to buy a single issue when I feel like it or if there's an event I see as historical. Sunday usually has me buying 3-4 papers to read over breakfast and throughout the day. (NYT, of course,  The Sunday NYT is heaven; my hometown paper, The Detroit Free Press; The San Francisco Chronicle; and often the Boston Globe. I feel more spoiled than ever now, because I'm taking advantage of having the papers *I* want, when I want them, without getting the editions I don't want, and it takes 2 minutes to select and receive them. When I hear of a good article on a day when I haven't purchased, it's usually found online.My recommendation is to get the trial and see what you think. See if you read it daily. See if it feels like a bargain. The beauty of the Kindle format is the convenience and so it only matters what method works for you -- subscription or my method of buying as needed.The NYT is 4 or 5 stars on the days I read it, but too expensive for me to maintain a subscription and allow issues to remain unread, so I'm giving it 3 stars overall since most people are probably reading this with subscribing in mind and strongly suggesting potential subscribers take advantage of the trial period.","12 8, 2010",A30YCQ4MOZAI6Y,Michelle R,I love the NYT -- sometimes.

However, it is an extremely abridged version of the paper.  So if you need some information like theater schedules, you need to use the online version.  The Kindle version is particularly bad since it has very little of the actual paper information.  It also is far inferior to the online version.

I suggest getting the free BBC app and USA today free version (not that I particularly like USA today).  But the combination of these two free services is far superior to the NYT Kindle version.

I am not a big print newspaper fan, I find them environmentally unfriendly, dirty (think blank ink on hand), and they contain a lot of information I usually have no interest in (ads, sports, stock lists, etc.) so they are thicker than I need them to be and messy. I won't even take the two free papers offered at the subway on most days (the excellent Metro and the whiny bloggy Boston Now). On the other hand I find the web version of newspapers hard to drill down to find the articles that apply only to today - if you know the topic you can do a search but there's really no way to tell if I at least skimmed all the articles for the day.Enter the Kindle edition which solves most of my complaints about the print and web edition of the Boston Globe, while all the material I am not interested in is still there it is easy to bypass and doesn't really cause any clutter or eat up resources (a few kb of disc space I guess).

If you want more detail you can select the headline link. You can then once finished reading the article (or deciding only to read some of it or none of it) easily hit the back button to return to the list, or if you've finished the article you can go forward directly to the next story (comes in handy in your favorite section if you know you want to read most articles there).

114,B000JMKNQ0,"[4, 4]",4,"Karen Traviss was noted during her time as a Star Wars author for her fascination with the Mandalorian culture along with her disdain for the Jedi. These traits fueled several exceptional stories in the Republic Commando novels but also started to become a bit of a distraction over time, especially as her stories became increasingly drenched in Mandalorian worship. It's an interesting choice to have her author a short story (originally an e-book) for the New Jedi Order, as beyond a nod in the final volume, Mandalorians are conspicuously absent. This story is very much like her full length Star Wars novels: Mandalorian focused, chapters starting with intriguing italicized quotes from various in-universe sources, and a very cinematic way of staging scenes and cutting between them.So it turns out the choice was a good one: having Ms. Traviss bring her sensibilities to the New Jedi Order provides a sorely-needed shift from the overall tone of the nineteen novels. It's fascinating how she juxtaposes Boba Fett and his allies against the Yuuzhan Vong, two cultures both comfortable with violence as a means to an end but diametrically opposed as to the means. This story is set chronologically before Vector Prime, meaning it could be a reader's first introduction to the Yuuzhan Vong culture, and overall I would say that's neither worse nor better than first encountering them via Vector Prime. It's just different, as Vector Prime shows the Vong through the lens of the Jedi and here we meet them through the alternate viewpoint of Mandalorian mercenaries.This story brings us up-to-date on an older Boba Fett, one still living the mercenary life while also having responsibilities as the Mandalore, the leader of his people. It's an interesting dynamic how Fett feels a sense of duty to this role while simultaneously keeping it at arm's length. The sequences where Fett and a companion walk through a Vong vessel and encounter the extra-galactic invaders for the first time is superb, as we see their disgusted reactions to the bloody Vong culture firsthand. The ending of the story leaves the Mandalorians as true anti-heroes, secretly doing the right thing while being openly despised for their seemingly traitorous actions. I would have liked to see this thread interwoven throughout the New Jedi Order, but alas, A Practical Man was penned late in the game.Despite any misgivings I developed over time with Ms. Traviss' tendency to elevate the Mandalorians and demonize the Jedi in her writing, there is no denying that she was an exceptional Star Wars author. Her stories are distinct, hard-edged, and propel along much like the films themselves, even when they get heavy on dialogue vs. action. Boba Fett: A Practical Man is a distinct entity in the New Jedi Order and well worth a read: even better, it could be read by someone interested in Fett and his people without having to go further in the nineteen books that follow.","03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Worthwhile addition to the New Jedi Order,1331769600

This time, Karen Traviss combines fan favorite Boba Fett and NJO favorite Nom Anor to show the Mandalorians' role in the Yuuzhan Vong war. Traviss does a pretty good job fitting both into their characters. Boba Fett is appropriately cynical, but at the same time also concerned about the Mandalorians. Traviss doesn't yet go so far as to make Boba Fett one of the good guys. It's an interesting character transformation. We also get to see Nom Anor's private thoughts and a bit more insight into his time as infiltrator.Even for a short story, it seemed a bit too short and ends rather abruptly. I would have liked to have seen  bit more, or at least learn what the Mandalorians did after the first few weeks of the invasion.

This is more of Karen Traviss' mary-sue adventures of Boba Fett and the almighty, infallible, infinitely over-detailed and completely boring Mandalorians, who bear a strong resemblance to Scottish Highlanders in an average B-grade romance novel.It's stuff like this that makes me glad she has decided to stop writing Star Wars.As usual, Traviss throws out established canon to match her ideas and fit her story. This book is pointless, as the whole premise is flawed, based on a non-canon idea, and will be zapped out of existence once the T-Canon episodes of Clone Wars (which trump the C-Canon (soon to be S-Canon or N-Canon) ideas in Traviss' books.)Traviss has managed to take one of the coolest characters in the Star Wars universe and turn him into one of the most annoying, uninteresting, boring, obnoxious, mary-sue characters ever written. She took the quiet cool of Boba Fett, and turned him into a character who just Wouldn't Shut Up. She took Mandalorians and turned them from an elusive, lost, dying race of people who were cooler for having been scattered across the galaxy, into a clan of dancing, singing, Mando'a speaking, boastful morons whose place in canon is now a convoluted mess.And don't get me started on how plodding and over-detailed her writing is. If you want to know every tiny, minuscule, stupid thing about a character, just turn to Traviss' books. You're lucky if she doesn't tell you how, when, and where Boba acquired his underwear, and what they're made of.Suffice it to say, I'm not a fan of Traviss' work. I consider her Star Wars books to be a notch below Barbara Hambly's disastrous efforts. Read this only if you're a huge fan of Traviss, or a huge fan of Non-Canon Star Wars books... Because this one can't stand up to scrutiny.","08 13, 2009",A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN,Raven A. Wind,A Good Reason Not to Miss Traviss' Star Wars Books,1250121600

When I saw this book on Amazon I was delighted and I was even more excited when I found out that she wrote it!***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***I knew from the Star Wars comics that the Mandalorians were involved in the Vong War during their invasion and that they fought alongside them against the New Republic.  But this e-book really helped fill in the gaps that the comics and the novels left.  I knew they weren't just in it for the credits!The visuals that Karen Travis paints with her story were just amazing!  Having Boba Fett walking through the depths of one of the Vong's ships was great!  I could almost smell the slime oozing from the walls and hear the squishing of his boots as he walked across the pulsing floor.  Also, having him compare being in the ship to being back inside the Sarlaac pit was very cool as well.During the book, the Mandalorians are faced with a moral dilemma.  They have signed up with the Vong, thinking they are just an army that wants to wreck a few worlds and they'll get some quick cash off of it.  But it turns out it's an entire invasion armada and they want to destroy the entire galaxy!  Boba Fett and the Mandalorians have already taken the job so they are honor bound to stand by their word and fight alongside the Vong against the New Republic.  However in doing so, Fett adds on that the Vong have to leave his home planet of Mandalore alone.  They agree and of course they are lying to him.  But this gives Boba Fett the time he needs to mobilize his people for war.  And when you have the entire population of the Mandalorian home world gunning for you, you might just want to reconsider your course of action!While fighting alongside the Vong, Boba Fett manages to sneak information to the New Republic about the Vong, their plans, their technology and their biology.  Eventually the New Republic wises up and realizes that the Mandos are double agents and they send a Jedi Master to parley with Boba Fett.  He tells the Jedi to keep this under wraps and to keep fighting against the Mandalorians as if they are the true enemy in order to keep up the ruse so they can continue to slip the New Republic information about the invaders.  The Jedi Master asks what Fett wants in return.  He only asks for one thing, that the Republic knows that a Mandalorian warrior died to save a Jedi Master.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***This book was awesome!  Karen Traviss continued to do what she did best in the Star Wars universe, writing for Boba Fett and the Mandalorians.  It really is too bad that she and the rest of the Star Wars writers had a falling out due to creative differences and that she is no longer writing for Star Wars.  I would have loved to read more of her work in a Star Wars setting.","05 18, 2013",A12LKEM543ILBK,zombie phreak,Terrific!!!,1368835200

I kept wanting to say, ""Whoa, slow down.  Let's learn about the characters before they go running off to be super heroes.""The Devlin Group is a group who stops Big Bad things from happening - like spreading poison all over Gitmo.Alex Rossi is the Super Hero leader who, at one time, worked with Grace, the Super Heroine. They were a great team with both of them equally able to get to the bad guys.  Alex also doubles as Sean Devlin, the founder of the Group.  He named the group Devlin to flush out the man who killed his Mother 11 years ago.  Grace was not aware of this story.  Alex and Grace had a baby but Alex was never told about him because Grace wanted to keep the baby, Danny, safe from the Super Hero's enemies.  All of this is for naught as Danny is kidnapped.  While this sounds somewhat complicated, Stacey does a good job of keeping things clear and the reader is never confused as to the story line.There are two other major characters, Carmen and Gallagher, who also help with the Devlin Group.The downside is that this adventure/romance is told so fast that there is little character development.  I know about as much about Carmen and Gallagher as you do right now. There was a whole story there left on the cutting room floor, so to speak, and the book would have been much better if Stacey had taken the time to allow the reader an insight into these two characters.Alex and Grace are somewhat better developed but still leave a bit to be desired.  Grace comes off somewhat naive in the ways of motherhood, to put it nicely.  For some reason we never know, she thinks being able to make cookies is more important in the raising of a child than allowing said child to get to know his father.  Go figure.  I still want to know what makes Grace tick.Stacey has talent but needs to learn a little about character development.  If the reader knows the characters, they care what happens to them.  While this is an exciting story, I never really cared if the characters lived or died except for what would happen to the child.","10 17, 2009",A109E01LB4H38F,"Carol Donaho ""Carol Donaho""",Way too fast!,1255737600

Pooter, a senior bank clerk in the City renting a home in a London suburb of Holloway, encapsulates Victorian respectability, snobbery, and pretensions. Pooter nearly invariably gets the short end of the stick in his interactions with his two neighbors, Cummings and Gowings; his spendthrift, reckless son Lupin; and the various tradesmen and servants he attempts to bully. Slavishly devoted to his employer, Mr. Perkupp, Pooter tries without much luck to cut his son into the same mold. Instead, Lupin slacks at work and spends his nights engaged in amateur theatrics or carousing with his chums till all hours. What's a father to do?First serialized in Punch in 1888 and 1889, The Diary of a Nobody was published in book form in 1892 and hasn't been out of print since.

It is huge, containing souls from multiple worlds, creatures only imagined by later SciFy authors. Multiple gates, minimal entry conditions. There is a caste system, and receptions for those who never received reward during life.I wish that wings were more than decoration, but according to Sandy, an elderly resident, you travel by WISHING yourself around to greet new arrivals, or return to earth with divine messages. Most inhabitants only dress up for formal occasions- halo, harp and wings being a sort of uniform.Sandy tells Stormfield: Heaven is a libertarian place- plenty of room, do as you please, appear any age- but it is not paradise as imagined on earth. Idleness does get old, and please do not irritate the patriarchs. Sandy is a keen observer of people in Heaven.The rest of the tale is similarly imaginative. Twain enlivens things by speaking in the argot of a 19th century sailing master, sprinkling dialogue with phrases like:' An ordinary comet don't make more than about 200,000 miles a minute.  Of course when I came across one of that sort--like Encke's and Halley's comets, for instance--it warn't anything but just a flash and a vanish, you see.  You couldn't rightly call it a race.  It was as if the comet was a gravel-train and I was a telegraph despatch.  But after I got outside of our astronomical system, I used to flush a comet occasionally that was something like.  We haven't got any such comets--ours don't begin.  One night I was swinging along at a good round gait, everything taut and trim, and the wind in my favor--I judged I was going about a million miles a minute--it might have been more, it couldn't have been less--when I flushed a most uncommonly big one about three points off my starboard bow.

This book was written during World War 1. The Western Front in the subtitle is the line where the westward-moving German army was being met by the armies of the countries they were invading. Arnold Bennett was a novelist who was Director of Propaganda for France at the Ministry of Information during the war. That's the background, on to the book...Bennett tells of the time he spent moving from town to town in France and Belgium along the Front. He is always escorted by a military officer, and they often walk through trenches and have to take cover if an artillery shell explodes nearby. He frequently goes into detail about towns and buildings that have been damaged or destroyed by the Germans. It's not a very personal book- he seldom writes about people he meets or relates conversations. Occasionally he muses on the absurdity of what the Germans are doing, and what it is costing in terms of people's lives and livelihoods. His cynicism shines through at those moments. The book will be best enjoyed by war buffs, but it's short, and an excellent description of a war zone, so I recommend it to people who don't normally read war books as well.","04 5, 2010",A39A6B9YR9R0L6,Phil,Life on the Western Front during World War 1,1270425600

To call them brutes or barbarians and murderers is not enough.  What they perpetrated on Europe in two world wars is beyond comprehension.  After viewing the wanton, unnecessary, almost childish destruction caused by the retreating Germans, the author actually hopes that one German city will be levelled entirely, as punishment, retribution, and as a lesson to future Germans that wars of expansion in Europe are unwanted and will be avenged.  This did not happen.Author tours the French and British trenches and rear areas, giving amazing insight into the French military psyche at the time.  That part, I enjoyed the most.

Then the plot weakens....One of the book's biggest mysteries must be that, whilst huge numbers of indiginent Pacific islanders evolve by scratching out a living fishing off a sand-bar of an island, this extemely large, visible (it has a huge mountain in the middle) island, remains undiscovered. A pity because this surely must be one of the most verdant, farming-friendly, mineral wealthy islands on Earth. It is also extremely well-stocked with all manner of useful, & tasty beasts. Our heroes, in a few short years, manage to become completely self-sufficient & are soon spoilt for choice as to where to abide & what to have for supper.I would estimate that a full eighty percent of the plot is dedicated to the ingenious, almost miraculous, development of the island's bounty. Our five heroes are the most innovative of castaways; nothing is beyond them. During their time on the island they have the know-how & resources to produce bricks, pottery, ironware, gunpowder, nitro-glycerene, etc. etc., even introducing a telegraph system & no detail is spared in the descriptions of each operation. As a consequence the book reads like a cross between Handyman's Journal, Construction Weekly & Farming Monthly.The castaways are a deadly boring bunch. They quickly become firm friends; respectful, tolerant & pass their time in mutual hero-worship & devotion. They are such a 'hail-fellow & well met' group that there is a complete absence of any sort of jealousy, resentment, discontent or moaning; indeed a complete absence of any emotional excitement.There is a mystery involved but I didn't feel it worth the effort of wading through the massive amount of technical details to find out the end result.Look here for blandness & do-it-yourself tips; look elsewhere for adventure.","07 30, 2011",A5CA9579GD7HJ,Bob Jarvis,Handyman's Journal,1311984000

""For heavens sake heave out the ballast!"" ""There! The last sack is empty!"" ""Does the balloon rise?"" ""No!"" ""I hear a noise like the dashing of waves! The sea is below the car. It cannot be more than 500 feet from us!"" ""Overboard with every weight!...everything!""I must say, that listening to this (via the Kindle's speech feature while I was driving) was better than having to read all those exclamation points, but I was hooked and enjoyed the vicarious adventure.Jules Verne's MYSTERIOUS ISLAND embraces the ever-popular story line of men surviving--even thriving--on a deserted island, but instead of getting there by shipwreck, these men have escaped from a Civil War Richmond under siege in a hot air balloon and are blown thousands of miles off course in the grip of a raging storm. Eventually, their balloon loses air and they fall into the sea and are washed up on an island. There they establish a settlement, and with remarkable know-how, tenacity, and courage, they make quite a nice life for themselves that lasts about four years, despite the challenges of tempest, wild animals, injuries, pirates, and, most intriguingly, a mysteriously benevolent but invisible presence that seems to defy the castaways' belief that they are alone on the island.This book was written in 1874, and must surely have been influenced by SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON which was written in 1812. The similarities are striking in the remarkably clever things the castaways envisioned, built or fabricated to ensure their comfort and safety...everything from their lodging and outbuildings to a small sailing ship. Between them, they conveniently brought extensive knowledge of engineering, sailing, ship-building, astronomy, geography, botany, and chemistry.The book does bog down occasionally, and the 19th century language is somewhat stilted. Every conversation seemed to include a ""my boy"" or ""my man""  or ""my friend"" (e.g., ""'No doubt, my boy,' answered the engineer...""). The characters were ennobled by the author to be unrealistic paradigms of 19th century virtue: industrious, courageous, practical, and compassionate.But these are quibbles in the face of the pleasure given by such a good story, and the way Jules Verne tied this book in with the story from 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA was an interesting and unexpected twist. This book is a classic for a reason.","02 12, 2011",AFFGYGNO989PD,"Elizabeth H. Cottrell ""RiverwoodWriter""",Rollicking adventure,1297468800

It starts in 1865, March, Richmond, VA. The capital of the Confederacy is under siege by the Union Army under Lt. Gen. U. S. Grant.Five men, Cyrus, Pencroft, Herbert, Neb and Gideon, and a dog named Top are trapped in Richmond and wish to escape from the town. The weather is bad, but there is a balloon tethered in the middle of town, and the storm seems to provide some cover as the Confederates are less attentive with the storm. They get into the balloon with a dog and set off on an adventure. They are blown west by the storm, and end up over the ocean, with the balloon losing altitude, when they very fortunately to crash on a tropical island, which turns out to be volcanic and large enough to have a variety on the island.Interesting that Verne uses a balloon which is only coming into use, as the device to get his folks onto the deserted tropical island.The five men are a good collection of skills and personalities and work well together. Captain Cyrus is their knowledgeable and inspiring leader with an engineer's practical knowledge. Pencroft, is a practical and hardworking sailor. Gideon is kind of a ""everyman"" -- observant, strong and resourceful and loving. Herbert a young, man learning and becoming a naturalist. It is a well done book where the whole crew works hard to make a life for themselves on the island using what is available. They do an excellent job using what is at hand, and make chemicals including nitroglycerine, using what is on the island.A well done and interesting adventure tale.

The only complaint was that there was a lot of detail put into all the different mechanisms they had to make.

They are thrown onto an island that isn't listed on any maps and well out of the way for any ships in the Pacific to go by. They even go on a short trip to a close but un-useful island to help a castaway. For four long years these escapees have to start from nothing to make themselves a civilized dwelling. They create everything from a house in granite rock and a garden and an animal farm to any mechanism they might need to create something to survive with. They spend their days working and building and creating all the necessities as well as some wants. They build two ships and at the last second when they fear death, they are saved. There are references to 20,000 leagues under the seas and captain Nemo as well as historical things.The story is long but with all the details you learn not only to feel like you know the islanders but also enough to see their surroundings and feel their anxieties.

Since it always seemed to me that Crusoe and the Swiss Family cheated a bit by bringing so many tools and so forth along with themselves, I really enjoyed the more scientific focus, and this has now replaced Swiss Family as my answer to the ""what one book would you want with you on a desert island?"" question.Parts of the novel drag a bit, but it's a Jules Verne novel so there's a good story here -- the Island has a mysterious unseen inhabitant, also, there are pirates, which is always awesome.The main flaw is that this is based on the 1875 Kingston translation, which makes a fair number of edits on Verne's original -- for example, it changes some of the protagonists's names and removes some of Captain Nemo's anti-imperialist, anti-british rhetoric. There's a more accurate translation available for free in the Kindle store, so I'd recommend grabbing the accurate version instead (look for the edition where the engineer is named Cyrus Smith, rather than Cyrus Harding;  Kingston reportedly felt ""Smith"" was a ""gypsy name"" and hence unsuitable for a heroic character. You can find that version in the kindle store here:The Mysterious Island)Oh, yeah, Captain Nemo. This book is in some ways a sequel to Verne's _Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas_, as well as to his _In Search of the Castaways_. The sequence isn't direct -- really more a case of cameo characters than a direct plot sequel to either book -- but you might want to read those two books first before picking this one up.","06 11, 2010",A1KPDKD7VYRE3B,T.

It reviews the fear and distrust many late 19th century thinkers had for societies such as the Freemasons, Marxists, and Anarchists, as well as their contempt for non-Christian religions.  When reading this book, however, it is important to keep in mind that these are the thoughts of two individuals who even in their day, were seen as fringe writers dealing in fear and paranoia.  Beecher, for example, was the abolitionist brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wroteUncle Tom's Cabinwhile Jonathan Blanchard was an abolitionist preacher well known for his inflamatory anti-masonic rhetoric.  One of their primary purposes in publishing this work was to reinforce the superiority of American-style Protestant Christianity over Hinduism and Islam, both of which had achieved a great deal of popularity among the New England academic and economic elites.  Freemasonry, another major topic in the book, had recently been involved in an event known as the ""Paris Commune"", where a group of Marxists and Anarchists temporarily gained political control over Paris.  Both Blanchard and Beecher were concerned that this movement would endanger stability in the United States where memories of both the Civil War and Reconstruction were livid, angry scars on the psyche of the nation.Secret Societies, therefore, provides keen insight into the logic and rational behind the deep concern felt by a generation of Americans that had seen their country torn by civil war and feared the rising popularity of Marx-inspired secret societies could lead directly to a renewal of widespread violence.","07 18, 2010",A50EGYZY7RHGI,"Brian K.

Sure, the money is for admin fees..a joke. He cries continually over money and references fees all around.

359,B000JQUSBQ,"[3, 4]",5,"Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and the World literature is even more filled with beautiful, unusual and imaginative stories.This collection of the Indian fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain Indian cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and talking animals are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""long, long, time ago."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary.

361,B000JQUSBQ,"[42, 45]",4,"There are twenty-nine stories in this collection. These Indian tales resemble the stories that flourished in Europe, such as the tales by the Brothers Grimm and by Aesop, although they have an Indian flavor. The collector of these stories contends that they are very old, older than the legends and folk-tales that later flourished in Europe. He believes that India was the originator of this genre and the stories were possibly brought to Europe by the crusaders or other travelers that passed through India.For example, the tale The Lion and the Crane is well-known. A lion was eating an animal when a bone got stuck in its throat. A crane offered to help if the lion promises not to eat it. The lion agrees. The crane protects itself by placing a stick in the lion's mouth to keep it open while he is inside the lion's mouth removing the bone. As soon as the crane removes the bone, it pushes out the stick and flies off to a high tree. Later, the crane asks the lion what the lion will give it for saving the lion's life. The lion responds that it already gave the crane a gift by not eating it. The Indian version ends by speaking about the transmigration of souls, a belief of many Indians. The lion and the crane were people in another life.How the Raja's Son Won the Princess Labam is another example of a familiar tale, although known in the west under other names. A prince goes in search for a beautiful princess. While journeying, he takes out his food and finds an ant in it. He places it on the ground for other ants to come and finish it. The ant Raja arrives and tells him that since he fed the ants, if he needs help in the future all he need do is think of them and they will come to help him. He leaves and continues searching for the princess. He comes across a tiger with a thorn in its paw. He helps the tiger who tells the prince that if he needs help in the future, he should think of him, and he and his wife will come and help him. The prince continues his search and comes across four fakirs with four magic items: a bag that give food whenever it is requested to do so, a bowl that offers water, a bed that flies and can take the prince where he wants to go, and a stick that will beat any group that tries to harm him. He takes the four items from the fakirs. He uses the bed to go to the princess. He uses the bag and bowl for food and drink. He then uses the ants and tigers and the bed when the princess' father insists that he performs tasks before he will give up his daughter. The final fourth task that the father insists that he perform is one that none of his friends or magical items can help him with. But the princess tells him how to do the task. The story ends by stating that the two lived happily and never needed to use the magic stick.","10 15, 2010",A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,Israel Drazin,Delightful stories that are similar to European tales,1287100800

381,B000JQUT8S,"[0, 0]",3,"Oliver Twist is one of Dickens' most liked and popular novels.Authors, let this be a lesson to you -- create terrific villains.Oliver Twist himself is a twerpy nobody 90% of the books. Okay, he asks for a second bowl of gruel. He fights to defend the good name of his mother. He walks to London in a week. That's all good, but it's all in the first quarter of the book.Afterward he does nothing but get entrapped by criminals. And be such an obvious goody-goody he becomes the friend of the victims instead.Indeed, the man who has a handkerchief stolen by the other two boys, and the family Bill Sykes tries to use Twist to rob turn out to be not only current friends but related to his real family.No author today could get away with such outrageous coincidences.The ending is a sentimental mishmash. He has a half-brother who hates him, and people are involved in complicated plots I could neither follow nor believe.What makes this novel live on is the portrait of Fagin the leader of a gang of child thieves. And the violent robber Bill Sykes and his girlfriend the prostitute (though you have to read between the lines to figure this out), who started with Fagin as a thief when only 4.Although he avoids direct sexual subjects, Dickens otherwise nothing to pretty up the reality of London's underworld of crime and poverty. Dickens got Twist out of this environment as fast as he could, but was wise to keep going back to the criminals, who are the only interesting people in this novel.Dear sweet Oliver and Rose just make us gag.","03 3, 2012",AS6HL0VD7H8PA,"Richard Stooker ""Author, Virgin Blood""",Great villains,1330732800

389,B000JQUTGK,"[0, 0]",4,"This book filled a lot of gaps in the Lincoln story.  It consists of a series of anecdotes remembered by contemporaries of Abe Lincoln.  Many are humorous  stories or jokes that he liked to tell and many are reiterated by more than one person.  Some are sayings lifted out of speeches that he made, especially that occurred during the Lincoln/Douglas debates.  These stories are more or less placed in chronological order from Abe's boyhood days through his whole life experience and end the evening of his assassination as he prepared to go to the Ford Theater.  These saying as remembered as coming from the very mouth of the to be 16th President prove that his was a life-long aversion to slavery in all of its forms.  I have read opinions that his interest was in the preservation of the Union more than the end of slavery, but I think these quotes from Lincoln's own mouth show his horror and outrage against slavery from his early manhood, not to minimize his desire to preserve the Union.Another area is Lincoln's faith.  These stories from Abe's own mouth show his devout faith in Christianity, the Bible, and prayer from his boyhood, and his ever intensifying faith as the horrors of the Civil War ran their course.  I have read opinions by contemporaries in his law-practice days that Lincoln was an atheist or at best an agnostic.  No statements of that nature come from Abraham's mouth in this book, and if at all true would seem to reflect a stage of questioning in his early professional days before he became a candidate for office.Several more observations can be made:  I did not know that he had been in love twice before the alliance with Mary Todd.  One girl named Anne or Annie had been engaged to someone from the East before she was enamored with Lincoln.  The eastern swain had gone back east to get permission from his relatives as he considered himself to be of a higher class and needed the permission of his family in order to marry the western Annie.  During the absence of the Easterner, Annie sickened and died.  Abe was devastated.  He wept at her grave and was disconsolate for a long time.  Mary Todd was his third love.  I hadn't remembered that  another suitor of Mary's was Douglas, the Little Giant, Lincoln's political rival.  Douglas was short, round, and well-dressed.  Most would have predicted that he would be Mary's choice, however, she unpredictably picked Lincoln, the ungainly, rustic giant.  It was commented that Mary saw the diamond inside the rough exterior.Another interesting thread was the many threats and assassination attempts that were made against Lincoln's life from the beginning of his political success and his unconcern about them.  He stated that he believed his life was secure until his Maker called for it.  He astounded people by evading his body guards and taking unusual risks.  In the last days of the war, he visited the front lines against all advice.  By the time the hue and cry arose to forbid such a risky act, he had already been there and safely returned.This collection was evidently put together and edited quite close to time of the events.  Much of the language is archaic to my ear, and when explanations are made to help the reader understand, they are still geared to a much earlier generation.  Some of the jokes lost their humor for me because of the archaic language.  At that time, the general public evidently thought that three of our presidents had been poisoned for political ends as their vice presidents would be more favorable to the desired policies.  These stories were not given as controversial but as the accepted opinion of the day and were mentioned to show that there were grounds to believe the story of a White House kitchen worker who said he had been offered a large amount of money to poison the milk of the Lincoln household.  (The teetotaler family drank milk as their favored beverage.)  The poisoned presidents were considered to have been William Harrison, and the Generals Taylor and Scott.","03 1, 2014",A3H10TBPGHYSII,"Patricia C.

395,B000JQUU00,"[0, 0]",4,"In my review, I'm more comparing how this book meets my expectations based on what I have read from the more well known fairy tale compilers like the Grimm Brothers and Hans Christian Anderson.  Some of these English fairy tales are very familiar, but they are not always quite how I know them.The first impression I had was that this book is more varied in terms of 'fairy tales'.  There are a lot of folk tales, and silly children's stories that don't have any moral or resolution really (""Master of all Masters springs to mind, as a short tale that seems to have the point of reciting silly words).  There is also a fixation on the name Jack for a lot of these characters.  I just thought that was interesting.  I wonder if they are all the same person.  There is also references to King Arthur and his court which I found very fascinating because some of these tales seem grounded in realistic detail.  They mention Kings who reigned and real locations in England as having seen the events in the story.  It makes the tales a little less fantastical, even when there are giants roaming the English countryside.Probably the tale that most surprised me was the story of Dick Whittington which now I realize I confused with the French ""Puss in Boots"" fairy tale.  Dick Whittington's story is much less magical, and more about being lucky enough to have a very industrious cat who likes to hunt mice.  ""Mr. Fox"" kind of stood out to me for its implied romance, gruesomeness, and the confrontation by the heroine. There are not too many stories in this book that are the same ilk. And lastly a story that I was surprised to see included was ""The Golden Arm"" which I was always more familiar with as a ghost story.  But now I know it is definitely a very old one.With the more realistic settings, sometimes whimsical nature of a few tales, and the English slang that is used at times, this book of fairy tales is rather different from what I'm used to.  I find it very interesting to read the original of familiar tales and see how things have changed.  For instance ""The Story of the Three Bears"" is more familiar to readers as ""Goldilocks and the Three Bears.""  In the original story there is no Goldilocks - rather the intruder is a very disagreeable old woman.  This book is definitely worth a read, for something different than the usual stories and perhaps to find some new favorite fairy tales.","04 23, 2013",A1Q434SYE6K31Q,Charlene,"Surprising, intriguing and wonderful",1366675200

397,B000JQUU00,"[21, 22]",5,"Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and there are many other folk tales that are not as familiar as these and yet are equally beautiful and imaginative.This collection of the English fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain English cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and unusual magical objects are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""once upon a time."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary. The dialogues, however, are replete with colloquial English expressions and turns of phrase, and these characteristics give the fairy tales a very folksy feel. This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike.","12 9, 2010",A36K2N527TXXJN,Dr. Bojan Tunguz,A Great Collection of Fairy Tales,1291852800

They met on their wedding day for the first time; exchanged vows; and the next morning he left joining the army.Seven years later, Mallory is tossed from her home due no payment as her wandering husband's uncle stopped sending her allotment.  Fuming, Mallory comes to London to confront her husband and demand a divorce.  Not caring one iota for proper behavior, she rips his head off in front of his mistress.  When John realizes the screaming crone is his wife, he grabs her and leaves his mistress at home. Mallory proves he owns nothing as his fortune has been embezzled while he dallied.  Together they seek his missing relative who absconded with his money.

There's a dash of humor, a strong romance, and a nicely woven plot with good tension between the protagonists.Mallory and John meet on their wedding day.  Mallory is only sixteen and John just a few years older, they are uncertain of each other and resentful as their parents have arranged their marriage.  John must marry Mallory so she can keep her beloved castle and John marries Mallory out of duty (he does not want to see her lose her home) and out of a need to please his father, a man who publicly claims John but privately eschews him because he is not really his flesh and blood.The day after the wedding John leaves and joins the military determined to forge his own destiny and not the one dictated by his father.  Over the years he sends Mallory funds through his uncle but basically lives his own life without laying eyes on his wife.  He returns to England and is a sought after lover and quite the man about town.Mallory finds John in London, in his mistress's house no less, demanding a divorce.  She has lost her home to creditors and she is infuriated at her husband.  John is astounded to see Mallory and even more surprised to learn that she has no home and that he is deeply in debt.  Seems his uncle has been siphoning off his funds and even worse loan sharks are circling him.  John knows he could go to debtor's prison if he does not find his uncle who has conveniently skipped town.  As his wife, Mallory could suffer the same fate so they now are on the run.John's friend lands them a job on one of his family estates, John will become a steward while his friend hunts down his uncle.  Mallory agrees to this plan mostly because she feels she has no choice, she wants to avoid prison.At first it was almost impossible to like John; he was selfish and irresponsible.  Mallory is completely justified in her feelings.  Their time as estate managers brings out the best of both characters and also their insecurities.  John realizes he is self centered and thoughtless; Mallory confronts her lonely life and takes a hard look at her reserved manner with commoners.  John is likable, smooth and smart and best of all sincere, when he feels something he does not hold back.  Mallory is more cautious, after all she was the abandoned one in the marriage and she is also uncertain in social situations, she lacks John's natural charm.  She gets beyond these hindrances and grows into a much more confident woman.  As she understands her husband her heart opens to him more each day.  This is a sweet romance about discovery, the leads not only discover how much they love each other but they also discover how to become better people too.","09 27, 2010",A3M3W5GV0HIQK4,Melissa,Romantic tale of a husband and wife falling in love,1285545600

Being the only female and the youngest, she enjoys any opportunity to escape from their constant vigil.  Thus she looks forward to her out of town work in Trouble, Pennsylvania to conduct on site research into a serial killer who owned Seaton House though she doubts she will find any sexual relief in the small town.At Seaton House, Lottie meets new owner Simon Lebeaux, who inherited the old hotel from his late uncle.  She immediately revises her thoughts that Trouble means abstinence.  However, several accidents occur including some near fatal ones as if someone wants to prevent Lottie from completing her assignment.  Simon thinks the hotel is haunted, but Lottie believes a mortal person wants her stopped.The sequel to the amusing contemporary HERE COMES TROUBLE is a delightful investigative romance in which the lead couple explores the haunting of the hotel and their hearts.  The story line contains plenty of action, but it is the lead couple who keeps it focused and entertaining as she knows what she wants (sex not a lasting love) and he knows she is trouble (he has enough tsuris without her).

Zangara made Seaton House an exclusive hotel in the nineteen thirties and was later convicted of being a serial killer.  Lottie is overprotected by her five older brothers, so she is relishing the idea of solving a mystery or two while relaxing and hopefully finding a hot guy to fool around with while she's at it.  Arriving at Seaton House during a thunderstorm, Lottie meets Simon and falls instantly in lust but Simon clearly wants nothing to do with her.  Lottie's not giving up though; she plans to discover the mystery surrounding the house and Simon, all while trying to seduce him into bed, but strange things are happening.

The effect was jarring to me, and I really wanted to skip whole chapters, especially when she's describing her own body as ""hot"" and centerfold worthy. Made her a lot less likable.  Then there are the continuity issues. In chapter 3 her internal monologue includes, ""Mr. Lebeaux. God, I didn't even know his first name.""  Then a few pages later ""the portable lantern Simon had left..."" half a page later ""hoping Simon would suddenly remember..."" so you think, well maybe she does know his name after all. Then in the next chapter she asks him ""What's your name?...Your first name."" There's a couple of other gaffs too but that one nearly made me give up on the book.The heroine goes back and forth between contemplating how many guys she's been with in college to then saying things like ""I don't have a lot of experience at this,"" when she's underneath the hero.

There was also a short review column on mystery blogs and a meaty, interesting book review column.  The issue was rounded out by a nice reproduction of the print edition's cover, two cute poems (crime-oriented, of course), and announcement of the magazine's 2007 Reader Awards.At the end of each story, one is given the option to jump back to the table of contents to select another story, but I chose to just sail right through and read the whole edition ""cover to cover"".

Like the handful of other Kindle newspapers I've experienced, the Kindle edition of the International Herald Tribune is laid out well, is easy to navigate, and features a generous allotment of photographs.  I'd be tempted to buy it more often, or maybe even subscribe, if the subscription and/or single-issue price was just a bit lower.

I find myself learning about global issues that normally are not even touched on in the usual ""lowest common denominator"" fare on TV. Happenings in the arts and sciences are also covered.The Nation comes out once a week, which I find to be a good rate of publication for a magazine of this type. You don't get the breathless ""breaking news"" type of reporting (a la Wolf Blitzer) in The Nation, which I find refreshing, but the issues are current and usually of considerable importance. The editors have time to be editors and the writers have time to do their homework. It's a more measured, intelligent approach to the world than we've gotten used to with cable news and screaming-head blogs.I do not find The Nation to be all that left-wing. On the contrary, I find a balance of perspectives from left (mostly left-of-center) to center-right. Importantly, there are no ""Screaming of the Extremists"" portions. There are well-articulated viewpoints and the occasional intelligent debate.

You also get actual captioned cartoons (a rarity on the Kindle!) and other fun elements.You also get another bonus.

You get the sharp, catchy graphics of the print edition (with the headline and sub-headlines of a story often embedded within the main photo just like in the regular magazine), and other pieces of visual flair- like the cartoons mentioned earlier- carried over from the magazine, too.

(I don't want to estimate how long it would take to read the Sunday edition.) Now that I'm older and have family, a career, and a life, there is no way I could devote that much of my life to reading a paper.In addition, the cost of buying the Times is high, even on a Kindle.So the Times has taken an interesting approach to the Kindle. In addition to making the full paper available, it has also made sub-sections of the paper available through Kindle Blogs, at a much cheaper price. This blog is the best selling NYT Blog, but you may be more interested in one of the other NYT Blogs, which are listed on an Amazon Listomania list.

Most of the aticles are hard news. However, occassional sports and lifestyle articles also appear, as well a very ocassional analysis article. Other than the analysis article, there was very little opportunity for any leftist bias in the articles.Unlike most current newspapers, the articles in the Times tend to be longer, with more background and context.There are two downsides to this blog. First, the New York Times is a New York paper. Some of the news articles will be New York news. Not many, but a few of them. If you live in Florida as I do, you may wish to skip those articles.Second is the transient nsture of all Kindle blogs.

Blonde hair, a figure to die for; she haunts his dreams and invades his waking moments.  He yearns to make her the love of his life and the mother of his children.  When he finds out she is moving back to town, his heart jumps for joy, all the while knowing that she probably won't even look at a man like him.Veronica Abbott has to get out from under her parents control, even though she has been married and widowed.  Moving back to her hometown, she decides to open a romance shop.  Taking a basket to the local fire department as a thank you for saving her childhood home from burning down, Veronica walks into the locker room and comes face to face with Dean Wolcott; the object of her secret teenage crush.  Veronica then proceeds to show him just how much she has missed him and is attracted to him.Dean wants Veronica with every ounce of his being.  He doesn't want to be her part time lover, he wants to be the love of her life forever.  He promises to give her time but is unsure if a girl like her will ever love him.Caught Off Guard was a naughty look at two people whose childhood crushes were still alive and strong years later.  I fell in love with Dean completely and absolutely because his intentions were so loving and so honorable.  I found myself wincing with Veronica's mannerisms and blatant sexuality, but after realizing how she wanted to finally be free from being controlled, I could see where she was coming from.  Caught Off Guard by Tonya Ramagos was a delightful read.

As a diversion, Jonas Maxim suggests they each reveal their most daring sexual exploits.  After all, they are men and sex is one of their favorite subjects.  The Earl of Grayson requests the opportunity to be the first to share his tale...Robert St. Claire, Earl of Grayson is stunned with the Sultan's gift of a beautiful slave to see to his carnal needs during his visit.  He's not exactly comfortable with this unorthadox practice.  To further complicate matters, Robert learns that the woman meant for his pleasure is no ordinary slave girl.  She's English and the daughter of a friend.  If he has any chance of freeing her, he'll have to avail himself of her many charms and pray that the Sultan will allow him to take her with him when the time comes for him to leave.Lady Celia Davenport had been the belle of London society.  Then she was abducted, sold into slavery, and expected to pleasure a guest of the Sultan's is most overwhelming to her gentle breeding.  When she discovers that the man she is to service is English and knows her father, she is great relief.  She now has a smidgen of hope of being able to return home but only if she is submissive to Robert's desires and pleases him. Otherwise she may be lost to the harem for the rest of her life.Each night Celia is brought to Robert's room where they share a bed and indulge their growing passion for each other.  Neither of them is able to speak freely because they are watched through carefully constructed peep holes in the wall - in this manner the Sultan can be assured that indeed his guest is pleased with his generosity.  If she doesn't please him, she will immediately be punished and replaced.Fortunately Robert is a very skilled lover and goes out of his way to ensure that Celia enjoys each of their sessions just as much as he does.  After their first night together, the Sultan gifts Celia with four perfect pearls - one for each time the esteemed guest found satisfaction inside her body.  Over the two weeks that Robert is a guest, his feelings for Celia grow while he worries about the future. Will he be able to successfully rescue her from a lifetime of slavery in the harem?  If so, how is he going to explain all this to her father?Emma Wildes' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB series is off to a brilliant start with this gem of a tale.  ARABIAN PEARL satisfies that wicked fantasy that many women have of being kidnaped and thrust into the life of a harem girl while still retaining a sense of independence and a hope for freedom.  I love how Celia changes throughout the storyline - she goes from a shy virgin to a self confident young woman who rejoices in her own sexuality.  Robert's blatant adoration of Celia really endears him to me.ARABIAN PEARL captured my interest from the very first page and held me enthralled right to the end.

EVERYTHING Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever wrote about Sherlock Holmes is here: all 4 novels and all 56 short stories. The informative introduction by Loren D. Estleman is an added bonus (though it appears twice in this ebook version, once at the start of each of the 2 volumes as originally published in paperback by Bantam). This ebook edition is very well-formatted, comfortable to read, has an active TOC (in which the short stories are presented in proper order), and even accurately depicts the graphic representations in ""The Dancing Men,"" unlike many other versions which substitute the word ""graphics"" for the drawings. This is undoubtedly the very best Sherlock Holmes collection currently available in the Kindle Store. (The non-Holmes set of 10 ""Tales of Mystery and Terror"" is sometimes added to incomplete Holmes sets to boost their story total. There is no need for this complete Sherlock Holmes set to do so, but if you want it, ""Tales of Mystery and Terror"" is easily obtained separately as a public domain freebie in the Kindle Store.) So if you love reading these beloved classic Sherlock Holmes mysteries, this is THE ebook edition to purchase--and paying only $2.99 for Bantam quality (rather than going with some incomplete, unauthorized, no-name, ebook bundler) is a very good deal.ADDENDUM: Since the above was written Maplewood Books has come out with a now updated and truly complete edition of its own at 1/3 the price of this Bantam version.

It has a really nice mix of stuff - how better to say, it's kind of interesting musings about all kinds of things, not just books or technology.The postings are very well written, as we'd expect from Amazon. The entries are about the right length. And they are enjoyable to read. I am addicted to Engadget, so I pretty much see tech events as they happen in almost real time. Amazon's reporting on those events is only about 24 hours behind, or just barely behind.There's a couple of strange things that just don't work so well. The formatting is odd at best. There's a lot of hyperlinks in the blog. Unfortunately on a Kindle they get underlined with a little character behing them and some spaces - so it's super strange to read with these annoying little characters. Of course you can open up the hyperlink by clicking, but it's kind of a pain.Images don't always work the best. They are OK, but sometimes there's more pictures that are important.Then there's video posted occaisonally, well that sure doens't work at all.Now the biggest complaint. If you happen to not read this blog for about 2 days, the old postings disappear. And there's no way to go reload them. So if on Thursday, I've forgetten to or not bothered to read Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday postings - most certainly there will be no Monday material. Tuesday has a shot at an article or two if the Thursday entry is small. Wednesday will be there. It's just not much fun to not be able to read old posts.Oh it does not feed to iPhone.So this blog is free. Well how can anybody really complain? I'm an almost daily reader now.Apparently this blog is somewhere on Amazon, my best efforts to search for it could not find it.

603,B000R93D4Y,"[8, 8]",4,"Magical, Mystical, Sensual . . . Enjoyable! While definitely all about the sex, this story brings a clear plot and a well-thought world in which our heroes and heroine have the pleasure of interacting. Perhaps I should say heroes and heroines . . . as the dragons are most certainly a major player in the plot of the story.There is never any inter-species hanky panky occurring, but the plot outlines a world where the dragon and its rider are so connected that both the dragon and rider are able to share feelings - including the sexual urges and desire that occur when the dragon is coupling with its mate. Of course, those feelings are intense, and of course they last for a very long time. (Dragons may be able to keep it in check for a very long time, but when they let loose . . . one should apparently be ready for almost anything!)The shared feelings and a lack of available females leads to an openness within the community around sex, and while there is no voyeurism involved, interaction may not be entirely behind closed doors . . . especially during a wedding! The lack of females also leads to an accepted practice of knights sharing mates - which is the case in this particular story. While there are sexual interactions between Gareth and Belara only, once Belara and her mother are brought back to the lair, that quickly changes, and Lars is added to the mix.There is an attempt made to slowly introduce the reader to multiple partners and all of the sexual exploits that situation can bring about. But, truly, there is lots and lots of sex in many different ways, shapes and forms. Outside of the sex, the plot does continue, and there is an epic battle scene described, and Belara's mother encounters the healing powers of a dragon. It's after this battle that Belara finds her dragon healing powers, and further cements her place within the community.A brief note: I was not especially happy with the ending of this story. It is a ""happily for now"", but it does set itself up to lead directly into a new book . . . a continuation of the story. Although not labeled as part of a series, the front cover lists the story as ""Dragon Knights"" - leading me to believe we will encounter this dragon community again, if not these particular characters again. That isn't a bad thing.A nice combination of fantasy and sex, this book is a nice one to pick up and lose yourself in!

It's the first I've read by Bianca D'Arc but based on this I might try more of her work in the future.Bolera is 18 and lives alone with her mother. She's out hunting a deer one day when, right after she shot it in the heart with her arrow, a dragon comes down and takes off with her deer. She chases him and finds where he lands and starts insisting that he give her back the deer. Instead of giving it back, the dragon carries her off...Gareth is a knight and the rider/partner of a dragon. He's surprised to find his dragon, Kelvan, flying in the a young woman along for the ride. Kelvan informs Gareth that she can hear dragon thoughts (a requirement for a mate to a dragon's knight) and leaves her there with Gareth. Gareth feels an attraction to her immediately and seduces her, realizing she's his true mate.Gareth convinces Bolera (and her mother) to come back to the Lair with them for a visit (although he has every intention of convincing her to stay). Because it's a ""mating"" that has a mystical element it's pretty much a ""love at first sight"" for them both and Bolera agrees to be Gareth's wife (aka mate). There are added intricacies that comes with knight/dragon matings that Bolera has to accept. When Bolera and Gareth mate it gives Kelvan the ability to claim his mate (dragon's can't before their knight's have mates because the mating fever would drive the knights mad otherwise). Now that Gareth found Bolera, Kelvan can claim his mate, Rohtina (a female dragon). Rohtina's knight is Lars. By tradition, both knights become husbands to the woman...in this case Bolera. It's actually pretty easy because of the whole mutual mystical attraction thing they have going. Bolera is a bit freaked by the idea of 2 men but is also attracted to both and has a hard time resisting. She does accept them and they merge in to a family (Bolera, Gareth, Lars, Kelvan and Rohtina).There is a bit of an action plot in the story due to an upcoming war with the neighboring country. There are creatures (being sent over b the enemy country) that are causing issues and the dragons have been sent to deal with them. At one point, there's a skirmish with the creatures and Rohtina is badly hurt. Bolera ends up being the one to save her and finds out some interesting possibilities on her origins along with the possibility of finding her lost twin sisters. The story concludes in a nice HEA.This was an enjoyable read. I liked the world and the dragon mythos. It's a cool premise and the rest of the series looks interesting.","08 31, 2013",A10DX94ATZQEFG,"Malinda ""I love books and love to get lost in...",Good dragon rider menage story,1377907200

I was actually pretty surprised at how much I liked the plot of Maiden Flight. A lot of the story was world building, character introduction, and crazy hot m/f/m sexytimes. This is my first m&eacute;nage a trios read so it&#8217;s exciting to get something new under the reading belt. Being a short kindle freebie I was pretty satisfied overall. I&#8217;ve read some reviews that mention how similar this is to Anne McCaffrey&#8217;s Dragonriders of Pern series and I can&#8217;t comment on that because I haven&#8217;t had the chance to start her books yet. I can do some similarities between authors and the worlds they create but I really don&#8217;t like copycats, just saying. I hope I don&#8217;t find out in the future that it was a little too alike for my tastes&#8230;The storyline concept was actually really interesting if not a little over-the-top. The dragons are intelligent, fierce, and very loyal warriors. They are matched with a human knight that they can telepathically communicate with. But the bond doesn&#8217;t stop there &#8211; the dragons are unable to mate until their knight counterparts find their mate first. Why, might you ask? Well knight and dragon have such a unique bond that they can actually feel what the other feels. So in other words the dragon sex drive is so strong that it would drive their knight insane if they had no mate to run to. This exceptional fact made all the sex scenes pretty fascinating. If there was human sex, there was sure to be dragon sex involved as well, and vice versa. This I could handle. The insta-love on the other hand I had an issue with.I mentioned in a previous review that I used to absolutely adore the idea of love at first sight. It&#8217;s such a dreamy and romantic idea that I still sometimes like to daydream about it. But reality and reading well-paced romantically involved books has shifted my judgment. I find myself actually cringing and rolling my eyes pretty far in the back of my head when insta-love hits a heroine and/or hero. Sadly in Maiden Flight&#8217;s case the couple (and the third-wheel!) gets hit pretty hard. Now of course once I got my eyes to focus in their proper position I just accepted the fact that it was part of the story. After that I could enjoy most of what was going on.  I actually enjoyed the romantic situation between the heroine&#8217;s mother and her perspective beau. It was slower-paced and much more realistic.Although there wasn&#8217;t much of a plot to be found I still enjoyed the book. I liked Maiden Flight so much that I went ahead and bought the next couple of books to see how the story progresses. I am hoping the sex scenes become a little bit more creative and the characters get more fleshed out. I&#8217;m hoping for more of the plot to come to the forefront about the war going on, the politics within the Lair, and I&#8217;d like to see more interaction between the characters. I like me some sex but I also like some dialogue, some intrigue, something, anything really. Hopefully I&#8217;ll get some of that with the upcoming books.","02 21, 2014",AR6U5BOVA5PYY,Mishel (P.S.

When the noble dragon, Kelvan, inadvertently enters herlife, Belora's future takes a sharp turn.Because of Belora's ability to communicate with dragons, Kelvanrecognizes her for the special woman that she is.

He has been fightingagainst the evils in his land with Kelvan as his partner, for a longwhile. Upon meeting Belora, Gareth feels instant attraction, and notesthat it is mutual. Because of the shortage of wives for the knights,life in the Border Lair is a far cry from the beliefs with which Belorawas raised. Gareth can only hope that Belora is able to accept thetraditions in the Lair if she recognizes Gareth as her mate.Maiden Flight is a fantasy with a dash of drama and a lot of heat,which completely fascinated me, but not in the way I expected.

617,B000R93D4Y,"[0, 1]",2,"I just can't drag my rating any higher than a 2 star here. I acknowledge that despite my love of dragons and erotica I might not have been the best reader for this book. This is one of those books in which everyone is always spouting off wonderful affirmations and bad things never really happen. Despite the storyline, it's like being stuck in a church van full of kumbaya -singing mormons who only want to help you see how wonderful you really are. The feel-good factor starts to chafe after a while.I think there is a plot that encompasses the whole series (of which there are now 7 books and 3 novellas). It's obvious that war is brewing, royal progeny are going to spring up somewhere, ect. However, there didn't really seemed to be a single plot contained within this book itself, other than lots and lots of sex. Unfortunately I didn't even think all that sex was particularly hot. It lacked details and a lot of it was same-same (for example H1 and H2 never even changed positions).Plus everything moves exceedingly fast. Insta-lust isn't even fast enough to describe it. Within the course of one brief conversation the h and H1 met, fell in love and dispensed with her virginity. Within two days he has asked her to marry him, introduced a third party (H2) to the mix and convinced her to be comfortable with all the other voyeuristic knights. Within a day of that she's rolling with the double penetration, draconic aphrodisiacs and apparently learned to have multiple orgasms a the drop of a freakin' hat with little to no for-play. I know this is erotica. I know I have to suspend my disbelief. I know it's fantasy and all in good fun. But seriously, I could not make myself believe anything could move so quickly.I did like H1 and H2 (H2 probably most of all). I like the mother and Jarred. I liked the dragons. I liked the interesting Wyre life...sorry Lair life. The idea of two men per woman is an interesting one, though male pairing would seem easier. (I don't think I'm the first review to point either aspect out.) I didn't care for the h though. The h, I might point out, who isn't even important enough to have her own name in the book's description, so you can imagine how much effect she has in the book. No, despite liking many of the disparate part of the book I didn't like the book as a whole. Others do. I can't say I cared much for it.","07 10, 2013",AUF0OPKICU6D4,Sadie Forsythe,not for me,1373414400
618,B000R93D4Y,"[11, 12]",3,"Reading the reviews before purchasing this, the first in the series, I was shocked at the negative responses.  I have always enjoyed Bianca's work, so it was out of character to see such reviews.Based on my past experience with her work, combined with my love of dragons, I decided to give the series a shot.  Granted, there is a lot of sex, but this is to be expected for the genre Bianca writes in.  This is an adult romance story & not for kids, which I read as a complaint in a few of the reviews.  How anyone could think otherwise, I have no idea, as it's obvious in the description this book contains sexual situations.Also, many reviewers commented on dragon-human sex.  I did not see this at all, rather the dragons matings affect their human-bonded warriors; I saw nothing untoward about this.  The reviewers made it sound as if the dragons and humans were having sex.  Nothing could be further from the truth.If you know this is an erotic story, with frequent sexual scenes, then you should know what to expect.  As for the story, I found I enjoyed the characters.  The dragons had a surprising amount of humanity, which I enjoyed.  The warriors were strong, capable, sexy men.  There were a lot of sex scenes, no question.  I would have enjoyed the story a lot more if there was more to the story than sex, as not much occurred beyond their meeting and mating until the very end.Bianca has always had wonderful world and character building, with a great plot.  This story lacked the complexity of her normal writing for me, thus the three star rating.  Other than this, I found the reviews to be unfounded.The best advice I can give regarding this story is, if you have enjoyed this Author's writing, you will likely like this, more for the potential as a continuing series than for this story specifically.  If you have no experience with this Author, I would recommend not judging all of her work based off of this story.  Her work, as a whole is incredible.As an Author myself, I know we don't always hit a home run.  It's not a bad story, it's simply not her best work.  However, I am excited for the future of this series, as I see the potential exists for amazing stories to come.  As I write this review, I believe she is on the seventh book of the series.I would suggest, if it sounds interesting, or like something that may interest you, give it a try.  Do not let the negative reviews alter your opinions of the Author, her work as a whole, or this story in specific.  To do so would be an injustice to a very creative and successful Author.As for me, because I see the potential in the series, I will purchase the next book and see for myself.  I have faith in this Author's writing abilities enough to spend three dollars and change for a chance to see where she takes the series.Also, there were several remarks made of the positive reviews being made all by paid reviewers.  To clarify, as an Author we do not pay reviewers, or pay for reviews.  People who review books are provided with an ARC (advanced reader's copy) so they can read & review prior to publication date.  This is done for many reasons, some being for the benefit of the reader (so they have an opinion to read on a new book), others for the Author (so they can get first-hand feedback early on from people who do nothing but read in their genre).Making an accusation of paying for reviews is harsh, unfounded and discredits the Author, reviewer, and the entire process.  We have no need to pay for reviews, and it would be a vast waste of (what little) resources and time we have.  After all, when the book hits the market, if the reading public does not like it, no amount of positive reviews from reviewers will change this.Also, I would like to point out the fact that most Authors have no say in which reviewers their book is sent to, as this is often a decision made and completely handled by the publisher.  As an Author, I am given so many copies of my book to distribute, but these are used for promotional purposes only (like a contest).  I am not allowed to distribute these books to reviewers.  This is in my contract.  So, to this end, making a claim of paying for reviews again has no foundation.I know this explanation has nothing to do with the story itself, but I felt it necessary to clarify, based off of some (poor) reviews, and their comments.  Especially given, if your profession is not that of an Author, you would likely not know how reviewers are handled.In ending, I'm off to purchase the next in the series; I know Bianca's writing, and I am confident she will take this series in great directions.Enjoy!  =)Shelbie Knightwww.shelbieknight.com","06 11, 2013",A1ZAPFF4YQ4IPJ,"Shelbie Knight ""Shelbie Knight =)""",Make your own decision,1370908800

626,B000R93D4Y,"[18, 18]",4,"Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogBianca D'Arc takes readers into an alternate world where dragons exist. In this unique world, dragons are bounded to their knights in a way that makes them both experience what the other is feeling. When Bolera, a fair maiden goes out to hunt a stag for some food for her family, she comes across a huge dragon named Kelvan who tries to steal her latest game. As they argue over who made the kill, they decide to see Sir Gareth, the dragon's knight to settle this matter.Bolera and Sir Gareth experience an instant attraction to one another. Sometimes I felt that the dialogue between the characters was a tad bit cheesy, but this book does have a fairy tale feel to it. Their romance blooms, and soon Gareth wishes to make Bolera his for eternity. The mating rituals for the dragon knights are very different. Going into this book I knew there would be m&eacute;nage in it, but in the first half of the book, the three major characters are Bolera, Sir Gareth and Kelvan, the dragon. For a second there, I thought she was going to have sex with the dragon! But no, fear not...there's none of that in this book. :)This is where Lars enters. Lars is the knight that is bounded to Kelvan's new mate. Since dragon and their knights are connected on a visceral level, when a knight finds his mate, the dragon is now able to mate as well. So since Gareth found his new wife is Bolera, Kelvan can now find his own mate. Kelvan's new dragon mate also has her own knight, Lars. Lars feels the erotic pull through his bound with the dragons and soon, he can't resist the urge either.Essentially, if the bound goes right, Bolera, Sir Gareth and Lars will all be mated while still being connected to their newly mated dragons as well. Together, they make their own family. While complicated at first, this story was a very unique take on dragons. I don't think I've read any dragon book so deliciously intricate.There's also a great introduction to the next book in the series, which will feature Bolera's mother, Adora.

But when she stirs feelings inside him, Ryan realizes that one decadent night of m&eacute;nage was enough and now he wants her all to himself. Finding that time and understanding that they were on the same wavelength only reinforces his feelings.To Ryan's surprise, what starts out as hot sex turns into something deeper. I just wish the story of Angie and Ryan could've happened without the m&eacute;nage with Wade. It just didn't seem necessary and it felt like a dark spot on their beginning.

The one issue I had with the story is that since it's a prequel to the Sophie Green series, I'd expect to read something in the story to interest me in the series. I really didn't. Sophie was a minor footnote at the end. On the other hand, I would be very interested in reading more about Nate & Samantha.

The writing is solid, if mildly uninspired, and the scenario could be very interesting, but it's tough to buy the whole 'spy who longs for a normal life falls in love with a grifter with a heart of gold' concept. Perhaps if there'd been more time to develop their relationship...but as it was, they meet, fall in love in day and go off to Switzerland on a ski vakay. Sorry, but that's a tough nut to swallow. We're talking about two people who lie for a living trusting each other implicitly. Yeah, right.As noted, there is a lot of potential for interesting and exotic sequels in this series, and I think anyone interested in the spy/romance genre would probably enjoy 'meeting' these new characters.

659,B000R93DPS,"[1, 1]",5,"Brody, formerly a special ops officer in the Marine Corp, is a 30-something Renaissance Literature professor with a thing for one of the students who just completed this semester's class.  Missy is 26 and working her way through college with dreams of going to medical school.  One night, when her crush, Professor Brody, comes into the adult store where Missy works, a little chit chat leads Brody to volunteer to teach Missy to play poker.  When a few friendly lessons in cards turn into lessons in the bedroom, Missy's inhibitions about her weight threaten to crush their relationship.  Can Brody convince Missy to up the ante and turn this two of a kind into a full house or will Missy fold instead?Do you remember those first few romance novels you read?  If you were at all like me, you snatched them from your mother (or aunt) and alternately grinned and giggled through them.  Part of it was because of the intimacy of the subject matter (even if the books were sedate compared to what you read today) and part of it was reading something maybe you shouldn't have been.  That's exactly what this book was like for me - I found myself grinning and giggling like a happy fool throughout the story.For me, this book had it all... a slightly dangerous, slightly possessive, handsy hero, a mouthy but shy-about-her-weight heroine, a whole lot of sexy banter, sweet but hot monkey love, and a couple of girlfriends (from previous books) that are supportive and maybe a little crazy.  I loved that Brody and Missy have a good time together, whether they're fooling around, fighting, or just having a simple conversation.  Brody is a little unreasonable sometimes, but Missy doesn't just let him run her over - she pushes back.  The back and forth repartee between Brody and his brother is funny and demonstrates their good relationship.Missy is somewhere around a size 16/18 (according to Brody's estimation, though a definitive size is never given for her).  As a result of the encouragement and self-confidence that Brody and her friends help to build up, Missy undergoes a bit of a physical transformation.  I can't explain, as a plus-sized woman, how thrilled I was to watch her change without having to lose weight and to see how well-received it was by her circle of friends.  So many stories about curvy heroines require that she loses weight to finally get the attention/love of the hero.  I was so pleased that Brody helped her to reveal this hidden part of herself while her curves remained unchanged.Since this book is listed as erotica, the story is explicit, but it's the parts outside of the proverbial bedroom that made this book so great to me.  When writing a story, an author can develop characters by telling you what they are like or by showing you.  For example, suppose you have a character that readers should believe is dangerous.  With ""telling"", the author has narrative in the story that basically says the Hero is dangerous - he used to be a Marine, he knows how to fight, etc.  With showing, there's a fight and the Hero takes on five armed men while he only has a broken pool stick.  With ""showing"", you get to experience and see for yourself that the character is who the author wants you to think they are.  It's much easier to tell readers about the hero/heroine, especially in erotica where so many authors think the storyline is just about the sex.  With this story, however, there's a magical balance of telling and showing.  We know Brody wants Missy, but then we get to see it.  He constantly touches her when they're together, he can scan a crowd to find her, he likes to hold her hand, he encourages her to be sexually open with him because he loves her body as is, etc.I've read several of Lena Matthews' books in the past and they're always well written with creative but still sweet love scenes.  This story was probably my favorite of her books and a fantastic value for the current (Kindle) price.  The story is probably a 3 to 4 hour read.  Highly recommended.","11 13, 2011",A88USYRFGDUTK,K.

The point about Brody being upset when Missy would make fun of herself and Brody's refusal to deal with it was mentioned so many times I grew tired of it. And I never really ""got"" why these two people became a couple. This one had less romantic attraction (in the beginning) than the other two in the series--it was more based on sexual attraction.

He's had her carefully investigated and he's perfectly aware that she never stays in one place for more than eight months because of her abusive ex. She's been his personal assistant for the past six months and he'd desperately like to get to know her on more `intimate' terms.  An anonymous email warning him that somebody would kill him in a kitchen gives him just the advantage he needs.Kyle's been very thorough in finding out all about Aislinn to the point that he even knows about her clairvoyant abilities.  Kyle's decided that it's time to show Aislinn that the passion brewing between them is too powerful to ignore.  Aislinn tries to deny him - and herself.  She even turns down dinner with him, until he uses his ace in the hole and mentions that if she doesn't go out to eat with him then he'll have to go home and eat in his `lonely kitchen.'  He has no doubts that the warning email came from Aislinn and isn't above using it to his advantage.  It's obvious Aislinn is as attracted to him as he is to her but her fears about her ex are keeping her from even considering any sort of permanent relationship.

And I got a kick out of her friend Christina and Kyle's `groupies' as she refers to them, Jon and JT, playful banter and sexual interest among the three of them.  Ms. McKenna does a wonderful job blending emotional situations into the plot so that you genuinely care about what happens with each character and never want the story to end. Fortunately, Ms. McKenna does treat us to Christina, Jon and JT's story in her follow up book - THE STRENGTH OF THREE - which is currently available.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","01 16, 2008",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

I usually really like this author and was disappointed by the book because it was just okay.  They story had a very interesting premise, but it was not fleshed out into the full story it deserved.  The shortness of the story makes Aislinn's capitulation a little too quick even though you know they have been working together for 6 months already. I would love to see this story worked out into a full novel by this author and see where it really goes.

681,B000R93E3E,"[14, 16]",5,"With an abusive ex-husband stalking her relentlessly, Aislinn has had to keep moving in order to stay out of his clutches.  She never stays in one town more than one month, remaining as unattached as possible so that leaving is easier to bear.  But when she takes a job at Turner Industries, staying isolated proves impossible as she finds herself irresistibly drawn to her employer, Kyle Turner III.  Still, she avoids becoming involved with him past their working relationship - that is, until her clairvoyant abilities show her a fatal vision involving Kyle!Kyle knows all about Aislinn's past, in minute detail.  Being ex-Special Forces and in the security industry, it is his business to know everything about the people close to him - especially pretty little personal assistants who distract him like no other woman can.  He has no intention of letting Aislinn run again, not when he can protect her from her past and keep her close to him, where she belongs...I do not think Annmarie McKenna can do wrong with a story.  I have loved every piece of her work I have read so far!  Two Sighted was a pleasure both to read and to write a review for.  It is books like this that make my job simple, and I wish they could all be this good.Kyle Turner III pushed every button I have, proving that this author knows just what women love in their heroes.  In fact, if you could place orders for men that would exactly suit your needs, I would want McKenna's help placing the order since she seems to know what I want better than I do myself!  Kyle is the epitome of the overprotective Alpha male who pursues the woman he loves with an unwavering focus and a sensitivity that belies his `he-man' status.Aislinn's fear and loneliness are palpable as she longs for those simple human comforts long denied her - a best friend, a phone call with her mother, a man to fall in love with, a home that is hers for longer than 8 months.  Yet even in her determination to remain detached, we see that she can't help but care about those around her.  While her abusive ex-husband may have stolen her sense of belonging, her hopes for a future, he hasn't robbed her of her empathy.  While it might be easy to be jealous of the woman who captures the attentions of the hunky Kyle, no one could begrudge Aislinn for stealing his heart.I was impressed with Annmarie McKenna's very first novel,Blackmailed, and my admiration for her work grows with each new release.  In Two Sighted, she effortlessly sets the stage for a sequel starring several of the supporting leaving her fans aching for it without leaving this book feeling unfinished in any way.  I know I will be hungrily snapping up any new releases both in this series and from this author!","12 1, 2007",A23ZNGL704AW7O,Jennifer Ray,5 Klovers - Courtesy of CK2S Kwips & Kritiques,1196467200

Will Dolan make his move on Cait? Will Cait's father make her choose between the life she's always known and the future she could have with Cord?Take Me is the first story I've read by Mackenzie McKade and it won't be my last!  Cait is a character I would love to be friends with and who wouldn't want to spend a night in the arms of Cord and Dolan?  What impressed me most about Take Me (besides the sexy cowboys) is the natural emotional complications which arose after the trio's passionate encounter.  I dreamily sighed over Cord's possessiveness and I admired how Ms. McKade handled Dolan's attraction to Cait.  In the hands of another author, Dolan's desire to start a relationship with Cait might have annoyed me or detracted from the tale.  However, this is not the case; Ms. McKade deftly handles the emotions of all involved and I was more than happy with the story's ending.  Take Me is an engaging read, filled with likeable characters and deliciously hot love scenes.  Sinful, yet satisfying, I greatly enjoyed Ms. McKade's book.ShaynaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","01 4, 2010",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Take Me,1262563200

741,B000SWV6HG,"[12, 14]",4,"I was so excited to read the series of the Buckhorn brothers after seeing what great reviews it got and since I liked one of Foster's other books I bought the bundle.The first story in the series is about Sawyer, the oldest brother.  He's a sexy, companionate doctor who's also a loving father and amazing brother.  The story starts with him having to safe Honey after she runs her car into his fence.  He's instantly attracted to her.  The story has him wanting to find out about her and she wanting to get away from him and his brother's because she's in danger and doesn't want to endanger them.  Honesty, I was so bored reading the story.  I couldn't stay interested, I didn't care what Honey's danger was and then Sawyer somewhat was bipolar to me.  He was practically keeping Honey at his house since she was in danger and he didn't want her hurt, yet she wanted to leave and he wouldn't let her.  At times he would shake her wanting to get his words through to her, but he wasn't a violent person according to his brothers.  There were so many other things about the story that drove me nuts.  Sawyer wanted Honey to stay, but wasn't going to tell her, Honey said she felt safe with Sawyer, but wouldn't tell him anything about her big danger mystery, Sawyers brother's were always interrupting him and Honey during an intimate time, and then when a big moment came between them that would have been so much sweeter in private it's done in a causal way with his brother's all around.  Overall it just wasn't what I expected or hoped the story would be.The second story is about Morgan, the second brother.  He's the hunky Sheriff.  In his story he fights the urges to become involved with Misty, Honey's sister.  His story was much better to me than Sawyers.  I was more interested in it and Morgan didn't switch as much in personality.  However, he did mess with Misty's car when she wanted to leave and I didn't really like that he did that.  Seemed juvenile.  His scowling got old after a while, but that was just his personality.  He acted tough, but he was a big softy.  Overall it was a decent story.Gabe's story is third, but he's the youngest brother.  He's the sexy, layback, fun loving brother.  His story was great.  He meets Elizabeth who is the complete opposite of Gabe.  She's prissy, a bookworm, inexperienced, and nave.  Gabe and her clash during the book, but also have a big attraction to one another.  Gabe takes it upon himself to show Elizabeth how to have some fun in life.  This story was a little different than the other two since Elizabeth is different from Honey and Misty.  It was a fun, sexy story that showed how opposites attract.Jordan, the third brother, was the last story.  He's the sexy, calm, vet.  His story was slightly different from the rest.  He meets Georgia, who is a dancer at a bar, divorced, takes care of her mother, and had two children.  Sparks fly right away between them.  Despite Jordan not liking Georgia being a dancer, he never tried to force her to quit and accepted her for who she was and what she had to do to take care of her kids.  I was worried his story was going to be short and he was a great guy so I was glad his story turned out to be complete.  His book was probably my second favorite after Gabe's.Casey, Sawyer son, was also more involved in this story and there's one he's in called Enticing.Overall the series started out a little rocky, but ended up great.  All four brothers have great qualities about them and some flaws.  At times in any of the stories things became predictable.  Also it seemed like every brother fell instantly in love with the woman in their story.  There wasn't a lot of leading up to them realizing they had feelings, it happened right away every time.  But in the end, you can't help but fall in love with each of them.","01 26, 2011",A1DX8P31MBC2PE,JJ,"Started rocky, ended great",1296000000

744,B000SWV6HG,"[1, 1]",4,"This romance book bundles the stories of heroes Sawyer, Morgan, Gabe and Jordan, 4 brothers who live together in their childhood home. Sawyer is the doctor, Morgan is the sheriff, Gabe is the laid back handyman and Jordan is the vet. Each man is in some way the pillar of their small town community, and other than being womanizers (in a nice and respectful way), they are all perfect. For that I gave a 1 star deduction. One decent, halo-over-his-head glowing, handsome, tall, muscular, sexy, honest, single, well-endowed, straight brother is amazing, two is shocking, three is a stretch, and four is defying the laws of possibility.Other than that each story was funny, sweet, and thoroughly enjoyable.Sawyer is a divorced, single father of a teenage son who runs his medical practice from his home and does housecalls. He meets Honey when she loses control of her car and crashes into his fence. Turns out she's suffering from pneumonia but is running from someone who's out to get her. Sawyer shelters her and takes care of her and in the course of that they fall in love.Morgan is single, large and a temper to match. At least he only pretends to have a temper. His bark is worse than his bite, but everyone is so afraid of him that his scowl is enough to keep miscreants out of his town and everyone else on their best behavior. Misty, Honey's sister, enters the picture when she shows up to help Honey prepare for the wedding. Morgan takes an instant dislike to her, a dislike which is only amplified by his attraction to her. He thinks she's too seductive and flirtatious and a walking billboard for trouble. What's more, Misty is broke, unemployed, and pregnant. Wrongly accused of stealing and had arrested and charged by her boss, then abandoned by her boyfriend when she announced her pregnancy. After learning of her situation, Morgan does a 180 on his opinion of her and works to clear her name.Gabe is the town's handyman extraordinaire. He meets Lizzy, a redhead he doesn't find particularly attractive at first, when she comes to interview him for a paper she's writing on people who have performed heroic acts. Not only is Lizzy carrying around a lot of guilt over the death of her mother, but she has serious self-confidence issues. This is a true story of opposites attract. Gabe is as laid back as can be, who spends most of his free time lollygagging around the water and sunning himself. He is well aware of his attractiveness to the opposite sex and his own virility. Lizzy is as uptight as one can get, freckles and burns if she spends more than a few minutes in the sun, and has no confidence in attractiveness or anything else.Jordan is the vet with the golden voice. Georgia is a single mother of two who works as a dancer/waitress to provide for her children and ailing mother. Burnt badly by her ex-husband, she doesn't trust men and doesn't know what to make of 4 men who seem to spend their lives bending over backwards to help others. Especially Jordan, who is great with her children and who has her mother eating out of his hand. Of all the books, this one is the funniest. Jordan's reaction to seeing Georgia dance in a skimpy outfit was priceless. However, of all the books, this one focuses too much on the other secondary characters. Between the romance brewing between Georgia's mother and Misty & Honey's father, and Sawyer's son, I felt a bit shortchanged on the main characters love story.What I liked about all the stories is that everyone is likable. So many times in romances we get bombarded with alpha male, testosterone laden, treat the women like doormats heroes, it's nice to get men who are both manly and sensitive. All the women had spunk which is something I also like. They all stood up for themselves when the situation called for it.Likable characters and cute stories.

Esme is desperately trying to escape her abusie father and marriage to an old and rather sinister man. She throws herself at St John to escape. The plot follows their romance. I found this well written but it failed to make magic for me. Perhaps this was partly because St John was not so likeable in the first book which I read quite recently and therefore could not make the switch to like him. Perhaps it was Esme who just kept throwing herself at him and despite several attempts to get close which failed, still did not really appear to be looking at alternatives seriously to escape what awaited her where she to return home. I cannot say this is bad, the 3 rating is based solely on my gut reaction and the lack of chemistry I felt.

Esme is desperate to leave her father who physically abuses her and is marrying her off to a much older man so she goes to her new neighbor next door who happens to be a rake - St John and insists on being his mistress but St John is trying to be a gentleman - after returning from war, he wants to make amends with his brother the Duke and his wife Miranda and so he wants to repair his reputation (plus he is poor though waiting to find out if he'll be an Earl due to an inheritance). So fearing that Esme might kill herself like she hinted at if she returns to her father, he takes her to the care of his brother and his wife and two children. They agree to help Esme by lying to her father about finding her lost and in an illness (Yea, I wasnt buying that). During the next few weeks, St John and Esme become close and her father keeps writing to her to come back home. I liked St John and Esme character but though I understand why St John kept pushing her away (but I wanted to strangle him when he talked about taking her virginity and offering nothing) and though I can admire a female who can read people and know that she is wanted despite the hero's protest, at some point you need to get some back bone. Which came too late, she finally gets what she wants and now decides to make up excuses to push him away? What!? I wanted to slap her. Then the story is like a soap-opera, now the guy she is be-throned to is even more wicked than her father. And Esme gets bad ideas in her head about St John when she was so sure he loved her even though he never said it? The book just had too many silly and stupid things going on for my taste. I skimmed alot so I cannot in good conscience give this book more than a 2 when it could not hold my interest and just got me upset.

After leaving with the emerald necklace the Duchess gave him, he had joined the army and served with distinction.  After he leaves the army, he must live one year scandal free if he wants a reward offered to him by the Prince Regent.Esme Danville lives with her abusive father who wants to marry her off to a man his age, if not older and just as abusive. Seeing no way out, she decides to become someone's mistress and thus get the marriage called off.  After seeing St. John breaking up with his mistress without laying a hand on her, she decides he is the one she wants.  After hearing her outlandish and most unladylike proposal, he refuses and ends up taking her to his brother's house, a place he is not welcome.  They do agree that they may stay under certain conditions.  The duchess tries to introduce her to eligible men without success.  Esme only has eyes for St. John who is trying to live down his infamous and deal with an addiction to laudanum he uses to deal with wartime memories.  It is hard to ignore Esme and his resolve slowly starts to crumble.After their inevitable return to London, Esme has to endure abuse from her father and despairs of not seeing St. John again.  He does get the reward and faces one challenge after another to  rescue her and get their happily ever after.Because I always wanted to know what happened to him after the end of the first book, I went ahead and bought this one.I think it is good and it kept my attention, something not all Regencies do.  I do recommend it to others who read the first book not only because of  St. John, but also shows how the people in the first book have prospered.  I do suggest they read the books in order as events in the first book are mentioned more than once.","06 14, 2014",A2Z0JW8EQ2EBIZ,Mary Kay McConnell,An Unladylike Offer,1402704000

771,B000U0NSV8,"[2, 2]",4,"My Favorite of the series.  It is the story of Esme Canville and St John Radwell.  St John was the villain in the first book of the series, The Inconvenient Duchess.  In the years since the last novel, St John has transformed himself and is in the process of making himself into a respectable person.  Esme, however, is looking for the villain.  In order to avoid the arranged marriage her father has planned for her, Esme seeks St john to compromise her.  St John, however, delivers her to his brother (with whom he continues to have a strained relationship).  As could be expected, however, Esme and St John become involved in a relationship.I enjoyed this book because of the character of St john.  I really disliked him in the first book and almost stopped reading the book because of him.  However, he has completely redeemed himself and I was deeply interested in how he has remade himself but still has to deal with his past.

Caleb McCurdy has just been released from a five year stint in a Yuma prison. He'd taken the fall for his outlaw brothers who'd tried to rob the bank and left him holding the horses. He'd paid for his participation, but his soul is tormented by the deeds of his brothers at the Shafton Ranch. Caleb owed a debt to the widow Shafton for the killing of her husband, something he had tried to stop. Laura Shafton remembers that evil day five years before in her nightmares. She'd lost her husband but she had her son, Robbie; the unborn child she'd been carrying. She's wary of strangers, so when Caleb knocks on her door to offer work for food, she greets him with a shotgun. While Caleb is mending her gate, Robbie seems to disappear, only to be found hiding in a tree. On his way down the boy falls breaking his arm, and Caleb helps Laura set the break and splint it. This builds a certain amount of wary trust in Laura and she allows Caleb to stay in her tool shed and continue to work for food. Caleb fears that at any time Laura's going to recognize him as the 17 year old who had accompanied those evil men, but he's matured a lot since then and his body has grown strong. Laura too is no longer the teenage bride; she's now a strong independent woman. Their attraction is something that Caleb fights; for he knows that should Laura ever find out who his is she'll never forgive him.I really liked the plot for this story. The characters are very well developed and easy to like. Though both Laura and Caleb are in their early 20's in this book, they've both lived a life time in experiences. Caleb has always been a good man, but he'd been misguided by his need for family, and so he'd stuck with his brothers. Laura is incredibly strong and resilient, almost over the top so. She'll survive anything in order to protect and care for her son.

When a person is forced to grow up faster, than they should for their age and face reality that is exactly what Laura and Caleb did. Caleb was an okay hero. What I disliked about him was that had been with whores. That is just disgusting on so many levels. I get that in romance novels guys aren't suppose to be virgins and women have to be virgins or have been with a least one man, but sleeping with whores takes it to another level. What I did like abut him is that protected Laura and her son, Robbie. Would I recommend his book to anyone? No. Would I read it again? No. It is an okay book to read if you 're bored. I would recommend that anyone who wants to read it should get loaned from a friend or something before buying it. Or else you will be like me who bought and did not like.

I didn't like the idea of the hero deceiving the heroine but he grew on me and so did this story.5 years ago, Caleb and his half brothers pass the Shafton farm house and ask for a meal. Laura Shafton's naive husband welcomes the strangers with open arms and soon the unthinkable happens when one the brothers attempts to rape the pregnant Laura her. Caleb tries to stop his brother but Laura's trauma over the attempted attack and the murder of her husband has her implementing all of the brothers in the crimes including Caleb. The 3 brothers leave and Laura is left scarred, traumatized and a widow with a baby on the way.Fast forward 5 years later. After being released from prison (being the caught scapegoat while his brothers get away), Caleb still remembers the pretty Laura Shafton and what happened at that ranch. He passes by wondering if she's okay and what happened to her. When he gets there he finds Laura and her 4 year old son and seeing her scarred face and haunted eyes brings back the memories. To absolve himself for even being there, he offers to help her around her ranch. She cautiously takes the stranger's offer and soon finds herself befriending the mysterious and rugged Caleb while her son falls in love with having a male figure around.I was really surprised to find myself actually liking this story. Laura is such a strong heroine. You'll cry for all she's lost in family, raising her son alone and losing her confidence in showing her face in town embarrassed by her scarred face. How she survived her ordeal and kept on moving makes her a heroine to love. Caleb is a hero you sympathize with. As a half breed (American/Native American), you feel for him wanting to be around his brothers and accepted but realizing how evil they are and trying to fully break free from their holds even when they're not around.I enjoyed Caleb and Laura separated and definitely together and her son is adorable and his relationship with Caleb and Caleb's ""fatherly"" patience with him made me like Caleb even more.Overall: I'd definitely pick this one up if I were you.

Her newly ex-husband didn't even bother showing up for the final signing. Her controlling, though well-intentioned, sister is ready to remove body parts off the man, but Lucy is feeling more confused than heartbroken. She wants answers for why her husband was making time with a blond bimbo in their house. Over lunch, she tries to explain to her sister that she's okay but ready to take control over her own life...as soon as she gets answers from Bradley for why he did what he did.Across the restaurant, two cops working on an embezzlement case overhear Lucy talking about Bradley and officer Zack Warren realizes that the tip he and his partner got to show up at this dive to nab Bradley the embezzler just went live. He confronts Lucy as she's leaving the restaurant...and then bullets are flying and he's getting beat up by the woman who's life he just saved.Lucy feels nothing but empowered as she realizes she's successfully defended herself against a mugging and takes off after the police show up to grab the wretched scruffy guy in leather who put his hands on her. She feels so empowered, in fact, she decides to dye her hair. Blond was a mistake, so she tries for brunette. Just as she's realizing that the attempted dye job left her hair dead and...well...green...the doorbell rings and the thug she'd beat up is standing there...with his policeman's shield in hand. Oops.Today Lucy got divorced, shot at, manhandled, dyed her hair green, and beat up a cop. She isn't having a good day.What started out as a sort of loony but amusing premise was quickly strained by an anorexic plot that pushed beyond the boundaries of plausibility or credulity and by characters that lacked more than superficial development. Zack is the Peter Pan who equates committed relationships with death and Lucy is the pushover who is so intent on remaking herself she's willfully blind to common sense.Though I prefer more three dimensional characters and found Zack's abrupt about-face on relationships as soon as he spends time with Lucy a bit hard to swallow, I honestly liked him. He's pretty uncomplicated and generally a nice guy - and any male who still wants a woman with ugly green hair is worth something. His character and his reaction to things is where all the humor in this book lays for me. I didn't find him believable, and he's pretty two dimensional, but I did generally enjoy him.What really turned me off this book was Lucy. I found her character to be so irredeemable - between her lack of common sense and worse, lack of intelligence, her absurdly obtuse reactions even after things started blowing up, and her apparent lack of self preservation, I couldn't figure out for the life of me how Zack could even tolerate her, let alone love her. I actually found her distasteful as a character and difficult to read when paired with Zack.Unfortunately, for a book like this to work for me, I have to like both leads. I so disliked Lucy that what would have been a silly and unrealistic but entertaining light romantic comedy, Getting Rid of Bradley, was ruined for me.Strange Bedpersons- 3 StarsOriginally published in 1994, there's little about this quirky romance about the ladder-climbing yuppie Republican lawyer Nick and the hippie, commune-raised, militant-feminist liberal Tess that doesn't feel almost painfully dated. That being said, Crusie pens a fast-paced plot that delves more deeply than I'd anticipated into the potential disaster of a relationship between two people who love each other, but who are so different they will never see eye to eye.Nick, despite his career-loving little heart, is a fun character who is actually pretty forgiving and able to compromise, though he does have a rather vanilla predilection for sex in bed. He's pretty darn forgiving of some pretty radical behavior and recognizes before Tess does that some compromise is in order, yet he still manages to mess up a little as he presses his own sense of fashion off onto the bohemian Tess and tries to wear down some of her rougher edges before he realizes that he's got to decide to accept her as is or lose her. I found Tess harder to like, though I did respect her commitment to her values. Still, her uncompromising attitude and selfish judgments of those who don't share her militant views were off-putting through most of the book.Strange Bedpersons started abruptly, too abruptly, with Nick banging on Tess' door and Tess closing it in his face, the two of them obviously already sharing a history. It took a little while to get the story on their history, so the opening of the book seemed jarring and left me feeling like I missed something. It made it hard to get into and I had to struggle a bit to 'catch up.' That did subside a bit as the story progressed, though the other issues - the dated feeling and my issues with Tess - didn't. Still, I can't argue Crusie's ability to nail witty, fast-moving dialogue and touch on human truisms with humor and intelligence. I just wish that prior to republication, this story had gone through a bit of a brush up to make it more socially and culturally timely and not quite so anachronistic to contemporary romance.What the Lady Wants- 4 StarsMitchell Peatwick Kincaid is a stockbroker, but a fondness for Sam Spade and a mild feeling of discontent with his job convinced him to get a private investigator license, and about a year ago, a bet with his boss and some friends - and a lot of alcohol - goaded him into leaving his prosperous career with his prestigious firm, putting the stuff from his monied life into storage, and taking on private detecting as a career under the name Mitchell Peatwick. And if he can get his private investigation firm into the black in a year, he'll win that $10,000 bet.Twelve months of private investigating, however, taught Mitch two things: everybody lies, and real life private investigation work doesn't resemble anything remotely similar to Sam Spade's life. Until SHE walked in.SHE is Mae Belle Sullivan and she's looking for a PI who isn't all that bright so she can lie to him.

Answers that will save Mae from financial ruin and explain what her reprehensible old fart of a relative was doing with all the art and keepsakes that have been disappearing from his house for the past few months. An overheard conversation pointed her in the direction of her uncle's journal, but it's been missing since he died and Mae's starting to get frantic to find it. So she lies. And she uses her feminine wiles. And she pays Mitch Peatwick just about everything in her bank account to investigate the murder of her uncle. Who was in his seventies, had a heart condition and a twenty-five year old mistress, and died in her bed. Mae's fairly certain it wasn't murder.Mitch knows he's being lied to by the delicious-looking Mae Belle, but her retainer pushes him into the black and secures his bet...and anything is better than trailing cheating spouses, so he takes her case. There are just a couple of problems for them both. Mitch isn't anywhere near as slow as Mae had hoped, and as more and more clues start to pile up, her uncle's death starts to look more and more like an actual murder - even to Mae.With a quirky cast of primary and secondary characters and a twisting, rollicking plot that includes suspense, mystery, romance, and comedy, What the Lady Wants delivers a lot of charm and a few good hours of light entertainment. Originally published in 1995, the story is a little worn around the edges and has a bit of a dated patina to it, but not so much that it detracts from the story as in some of Crusie's books. It's more like a faint scent on the air than a bat upside the head. Noticeable, but not painful.Mitch is a fun character, and quicker than he looks. Which is probably a good thing. I'm dating myself here, but he reminded me a lot of Magnum PI or Rick Simon from Simon & Simon - a bit cynical about life, a bit sloppy on the outside but sharp and thorough when he needed to be. Mae was endearing. Intelligent and kind, with a streak of independence a mile wide and a determination that is formidable. She's a bit stubborn when she needs to be, but not so cold as to be unappealing as a person. She cares about the people she loves and takes on the responsibility of caring for them, as needed. Together they made a good couple, and their banter was one of the high points of the book.Crusie excels at quickly paced plots with quirky characters and a lot of witty, intelligent, and sarcastic banter. It's what keeps me coming back to her when I want or need some brain candy. I'd love to see this story get a bit of a modernized polish to clear away the dated patina, but even as it stands, I liked it quite a bit.Charlie All Night- 3.5 StarsWhen you're the go-to girl at the radio station and you're producing the number one drive time show in the area, you've got a lot of responsibility and your future is looking bright. When the talent of that show dumps you, then two months later fires you from the show, you're bright future starts to look more like flames from a crash and burn. Allie McGuffey is feeling the heat from those flames after her radio personality ex-boyfriend Mark dumps her as producer and the station puts her on a new overnight time slot. Pushed from drive time to overnight is humiliating. Pushed there by her ex-boyfriend with his supercilious attitude and delusions of competency is even worse.Putting on a good face just leads to another crisis as a mad dash to the nearest bar/restaurant with her ex hot on her heels forces Allie into uncharted waters. She picks up the first non-suit wearing male she can find and desperately tries to act like she's perfectly okay while her insides are still quaking. Though the rugged man she clings to is obviously surprised by her blatant come on, he doesn't sell her out, which makes him a hero in Allie's book.Charlie Tenniel is a bit of a bounce around. He doesn't stay in one place too long, doesn't limit himself to doing one thing for his life, either. His wanderlust is a constant disappointment for his socially formidable father. His brother, radio personality Ten Tenniel, was more the man his father wanted him to be, but look where that got him - a drug habit and escape from prosecution courtesy of their father's connections. Charlie wasn't going to go out like that. He was, however, going to take the job his father wanted him to take as a favor to the station owner, an old family friend. An anonymous tip claims knowledge of a drug ring opperating from the station and Charlie's been conscripted to chase down the responsible party. He just wants to fly under the radar for the six weeks or so he plans to stay in town, so having Allie pressed up against him is just fine, but when he realizes she's his new producer and intends to make him a star, he's just as adamant that she doesn't.His position would probably be a lot stronger if he could just stay out of her bed.While the premise of Charlie All Night is a bit of a stretch and the actions of Allie and Charlie seem more than a little irresponsible both sexually and professionally, I can't argue that the story itself is light, fun entertainment with plenty of endearing moments. I enjoyed the banter and romantic development between Allie and Charlie. Crusie does banter and endearing really well and it's definitely in evidence here. There's not much to the plot, though, and with an original publication date of 1996, there's a dated feel to both the technology and equipment described in the station and a definite pre-Monica Lewinsky air of sexual permissiveness in the work place that didn't translate well for me.So long as you don't take the book too seriously, or expect much in the way of depth of plot or character, there's still a lot of entertainment to be had from the story of Charlie and Allie, two people who won't be poster children for sexual harassment litigation any time soon, but who still managed to make me chuckle.Originally reviewed by title for One Good Book Deserves Another.","09 5, 2010",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",Humor But Little 'Contemporary' Romance,1283644800

820,B000UMZMP6,"[2, 2]",4,"This story has several themes I personally really enjoy in erotica or erotic romance: full-figured heroine, military hero, interracial relationship, and an element of coercion. Although the coercion is a small part of the story, and I wouldn't characterize it as hardcore or full-on, it is still there for me to enjoy. Now, I know this idea of coercion doesn't work for everyone, but Abby's seeking to appease Mason with her body was very hot to me.Plus, she really wasn't doing something she didn't want to do. She'd been resisting Mason for weeks, denying him at every turn, and I think this was a convenient reason for her to give in to her attraction to Mason. For his part, he sees this as an opportunity to force her to spend some time with him and to take a chance on him. And how she resisted this man for a month, I just do not know. A military alpha with that commanding presence, muscular body, beautiful brown skin, sexy bedroom eyes, and a total good guy all the way around-- What was the girl thinking?Abby does have her reasons for resisting him, and as she and Mason spend the weekend together, stronger feelings other than lust develop. This story isn't long; it's actually around 58 pages. There is lots of sex, but it's done the way I love sex to be done: super hot, well-written, with the sexy edge of an in-charge man, and with a very sweet emotional connection between h/H. While there is no 'I love you' moment, I definitely felt HEA was in store for this couple. I thought it was a hot read with one very yummy hero who was tired of taking 'No' for an answer. There's no way Abby's getting away from him now.","09 1, 2011",A37J3XRX1TENTS,S. Richards,Trusting Mason,1314835200

They had met at a rodeo where Rafe was riding a huge bull and dry humped in a barn later.  Cathy was letting down her hair by going to the rodeo instead of sipping champagne at the country club before heading back to Boston to take  her place as an  attorney  in family tradition and never regretted their love making until she went home and he never called,  Then one day he was on her door step and her heart bounded in her chest as she invited him in for a drink where he proposed and she accepted.  It had been four years ago and most of last year they rarely saw each other, he treated her like fragile porcelin instead of a wife; it was moneey from her trust fund that saved the ranch and her salary that kept them in the black yet her name was not on the deed!The moment Rafe sat atop the bull and glanced at the pretty woman with clothes so new they screamed designer he was hooked and when she smiled he was a goner!  Seven seconds later he was thrown but he did not care because he had to meet this woman!  Looking back, the sex was amazing but when she got hired by the county she stayed away longer and longer and he knew she wanted him to do some thing but for the life of him he did not know what! Standing there watching her go he choked on the lump in his throat knowing she took his heart with her.Dee S. Knight pens one terrific read that will make you shed tears, squirm, and be glued to your seat at the same time as you rapidly read!

Will these two who obviously love each other find a way to salvage their marriage and start to trust in one another?Second Wind is a very good story.  Communication and trust is the key to a solid relationship.  Rafe and Cathy had neither of these and to add to their problems, their jobs didn't leave them with much one on one time.  Cathy did well by Rafe, and honestly she gave a whole lot more than she got from him.  Rafe wasn't a bad person he just wasn't on Cathy's level, but opposites do attract and that was definitely demonstrated here.  What they lacked in other aspects of their marriage they compensated with the strong passion they had for each other.  They were hot together but need to work on life outside the bedroom.

I even rebooted my kindle thinking the story loaded wrong. Then spent 15 min combing through pages and pages of blurbs for other stories looking for a sequel with no luck. I have read many stories by this author, some I liked and some I didn't. However, I have never been so pissed or so disappointed and disgusted as I am now. I gave 2 stars cause the story was started so well, but there was hardly any relationship development. Just basically 2 guys with insane chemistry.

It's his willingness, even when he's not sure of it, to step out of his comfort space that I liked. There's a very touching moment when he struggles with what he wants from Jeff. I loved that scene, even though it broke my heart.Jeff is hard to understand. He's got a lot going on and a lot to hide. But it's believable. He can't lose his daughter, but he can't seem to let go of Ryan. That sort of conundrum is a good one to have in some ways. Ryan's a hunky catch. Anna, Jeff's daughter, adds a cute and heartwarming touch. She's smitten with Ryan and totally in favor of her daddy being happy. If only all people could be that understanding...If you want a story that's hot and has a sizzling scene in a Camaro (my vehicular weapon of choice), then you need to read Custom Ride.

Lucia is a commoner who is working as a serving maid at a local tavern. Lucia has been trying to help a dragon (Sir Reynor) who is hurtand ill, but her skills are not up to the job. She finally goes to the castle to get help from a healer and is immediately involvedwith the dragon's knight Sir Marcus and his partner Sir Kaden, Reynor's mate.Lucia is a from the country of Helios, raised by the Jinn, she does not have a commoner background, she has a limited healing ability and is not afraid of dragons. Sir Marcus is totally captivated by her and his partner is also attracted in spite of his feelingsof guilt about Reynor's injury. The three can become a family, if Reynor can be healed and is able to fly again. Learning about Lucia's background and why she doesn't act the part of a serving maid becomes part of her attraction to the two knights.This story was listed as number 4.5 in the series and was only $2.66.

No matter, she was just determined to save her dying friend, the dragon Reynor, and to do that she must engage the help of his Knight, Sir Kaden, or his love, the dragoness Linea.A waitress in a simple pub, Lucia certainly never expected to return to the tavern with two dragons, two Knights, and the Queen of Draconia herself in tow!  But it is just this troupe of heroes that arrive in time to help Reynor, for it is not just his body that is withering, but his spirit as well.It soon becomes clear to Knights Kaden and Marcus that Lucia is their mate, fated to complete the union between dragons and knights and round out their family.  But Lucia isn't from Draconia, and while she has heard rumor of the strange custom in which two Dragon Knights must marry one woman, she is uncertain she can go through with it...If you have read many of my reviews, it is no secret to you that I am a huge fan of author Bianca D'Arc, and most especially her Dragon Knights stories.  You can imagine my pleasure that she continues to imagine new stories for this fascinating series, and that she seems to have no trouble finding ways to keep the stories fresh and exciting, as proven once more with the newest edition in the saga, Wings of Change.With this new story, we enjoy a return to the m&eacute;nage theme that began the series.  This scenario guarantees some built-in angst for the story as Lucia tries to come to terms with the idea of mating with two men, a situation beyond her experience or the societal norms of her own country.  But Kaden and Marcus are more than up to the task of convincing her that their love is true and right, with a little help from Marcus' dragoness, the Lady Linea.Of course, the relationship between these three isn't the sole focus of D'arc's book - she fleshes it out nicely with some long-hidden secrets about Lucia, some of which she herself is hiding, and a few of which have been long hidden from her.  As we learn Lucia's secrets, we see that she may very well be a most important figure in the future of the war between Draconia and Sskithdron.The author introduces us to yet another most intriguing new species, something I believe I'm becoming rather spoiled on!  As a long-time lover of Fantasy stories, my excitement with the introduction of each new creature builds more and more, expanding not only the horizons within this world, but my interest as well.Wings of Change is the fifth story in the Dragon Knights series, and will be released in print in the future anthology, I Dream of Dragons I.  While this book can be read as a standalone without leaving the reader confused, the story will be best enjoyed if you read the entire series in order.

She wakes up in a motel room the next day with a concussion.  Mac is with her.  He was recently hired to work with her on the horse farm.  Together they try to figure out what is going on and what to do about it.  Maris has no memory of what she was doing before she was injured.  Maris realizes she is attracted to Mac.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This was about half the length of a typical romance novel.  It was a ""falling in lust"" story.  There was no time for any relationship development.  It was shallow.  I wanted more intrique, unique characters, and more interesting plot and dialogue.  But if you loved the series, you might like this out of curiosity.After the mystery and danger is over, a chunk of time is spent with Maris' family in Wyoming.  There is the cute little toddler, all the hunky men, their wives and children.  Everyone is loving and protective.  It was a pleasant time.OTHER BOOKS:There are five Mackenzie books.  The first three were much better than books 4 and 5.  This is book 4.  For a list of my reviews of all five books, see my 5 star review of Burn posted 7-11-09.CAUTION SPOILER:I didn't understand the scene in which Maris was hit in the head (which was told and not shown).  Apparently the bad guy was starting to inject the horse when Maris arrived.  He hits her in the head causing a concussion, but she is able to get on the horse and ride away.  Can one be concussed and still mount and ride?  Why couldn't the bad guy finish the injection as she was mounting?  I wanted more details and showing, not telling.DATA:Kindle count story length: 1462.  Swearing language: mild.  Sexual language: mild.  Number of sex scenes: 1, about a page long.

Certainly not all gay men, or even all ""bottoms.""  Yet, I rarely see readers griping about how so many romances have strong, handsome men either - why aren't they short and ugly to avoid being stereotypical?

The focus on them was mainly on them being clumsy and I would say immature.

He's sizing up the local werewolf pack, introducing himself so he can scope out the feasibility of moving here. What he finds is a ruthless pack Alpha who is abusing his Omega, a werewolf named Laine, and terrorizing the rest of the pack.

The pace is swift, though the danger presented within the pages seems to be dispelled too easily to make for any real suspense. Still, it's a totally fun and engrossing story.I heartily recommend it, and especially recommend ""Without Reservations"" and ""With Caution"" (in that order), two more stories set in the same universe (the characters in this book have been mentioned in Without Reservations).

It made for a good attention grabber.  Now while I don't mind that feeling when it comes to a plot line in general, I'm not so keen on it when it comes to the romance side of the plot so I read this one with mixed feelings in the beginning.  Glad I gave it a chance.  It still wouldn't be my favorite romance plot, but it turned out to be a fun story.Dev drives out to a predetermined meeting place to meet the alpha of the pack in the area he plans on relocating too.  Just as he arrives, he witness the alpha and his betas punish the pack omega.  They are holding him down getting ready for a rape and Dev rescues the smaller man.When Dev gets the guy away, he discovers that the handsome man is his mate.

The alpha steps up his aggression towards Laine forcing Dev's hand.  But even though that Laine is rather a klutz, he wants to help Dev take on the alpha and his betas.It is a novella length story so the plot jumps in and gets going quickly.  The shifter world described here includes the idea that when the wolves find their mate, there is a bond made.  Sometimes I don't mind this, but it happened before I had a chance to really get to know the characters so I wasn't sold on this relationship until late in the story.  These two went at it hot and heavy before they barely got past learning each other's first names.  Now don't get me wrong, I learned to like both characters once I got to know them and I liked them together.  Laine's klutziness and his sweet temperament were cute and Dev's patience and gentleness with Laine was nice.  It was not hard picturing Dev as a pack alpha just because of the two sides to his personality.  He liked to be in charge, but he was also very protective.  And that reminds me of another thing about this particular shifter world, I liked the idea of the different designations for those involved in the pack.  We are all familiar with alphas, and get the idea of betas who are the alpha's lieutenants, but I thought the inclusion of the lesser used omega or peacemaking wolf role was pretty cool.It was a light quick read that I can recommend to those who enjoy PNR that is more on the passionate side and isn't very dark.","11 9, 2012",A3MT311233OHMQ,"Sophia Rose ""Guest Reviewer for Delighted Rea...",Quick Fun Read That Jumps Right in With the Plot and Romance,1352419200

The wife suspects her husband of keeping a mistress after she finds a diamond bracelet in their drawers and then later finds out that she was not the recipient of said bracelet when bracelet disappears. He picked up the bracelet for his brother unbeknownst to his wife, so the misunderstanding begins.Armed with her suspicions, the wife feels she needs to shake up their marriage and win her husband back from the arms of the phantom mistress. The books begins when she announces over breakfast that she wants to take on a lover. Her husband is reading the paper and not paying attention to the conversation, agrees with everything she says.  She feels that after six years of marriage and two children, their marriage has become dull and is concern that her husband has or will look for a mistress to spice things up.The two still love each other very much, but marriage for them has become somewhat a rut after six years.  So what does this couple do? They go through the charade of finding her a lover. He tells her he wants to help select her lover. She agrees and then blackmails his twin brother to pretend to be her lover and pursue her anonymously. Her husband also seeks help from his brother to play the role of the lover and pursue her (but not bed her), so she does not have the time to seek another lover. Neither is aware that the brother is the only one privy to the dual roles he is playing.In the end, the husband realizes that he had been taking his wife for granted and has not lived up to his promises of giving her the adventure he spoke of during their courtship. He also admits to his brother and himself of recently developing a wondering eye and possessing a feeling of restlesstness  He knows that he has been neglecting her and not telling her how much he loved her and that he was the one  responsible for allowing their marriage to fall into a rut. He then likens his comfortable marriage to an untended garden.

Putting a book as a freebie draws in those with no interest in the genre.All that said, the demon tale is one I would choose to read from a favorite author, as I am a fan of horror and supernatural fiction, so I reserve the right to be a tad critical. The set up of the story (the pre-prologue, if you like) was great. It tells the history of the demons, how they came to be. It was well written, interesting & gave me hope that it would be a great book.  As another reviewer stated though, the actual prologue was rather cliche-ridden with Gage and his ""lethal charm"" and Jordan resisting at every turn until she melted into his kisses. But I pushed on....As we know from the pre-prologue, Shadow Demons roam the earth. They are evil, they feed on emotion. Jordan, our heroine, is a vigilante destroyer: cop by day, demon slayer by night, after she witnessed the brutal murder of her partner and lover at the sword of a Shadow Demon.The storyline itself isn't bad, but it does lack development of the characters. Other than Jordan being stubborn and feisty, there's not much else that we learn about her. The twist in the tale isn't shocking - not because I expected it (I didn't at all) but because we didn't get to know enough about any of the other characters to really care, and so when the twist was revealed, it gave me more of a ""oh"" reaction than a ""WOW! I never would have guessed"" shocker.My title calls this repetitive, and it does become so. The same fight scenes replay, but worse - the same sex scene is basically repeated over and over. I think even those readers who love a racy sex scene would be disappointed. By the 3rd replay, I skipped them altogether. Nothing new here.","11 7, 2009",A3JR6D5B9WF5J8,Danielle,Repetitive story line,1257552000

I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  If you like the fantasy or urban fantasy type novels, I think you might like this one.  Be aware that this book has some rather racy bits in it, so I don't think kids should probably read it.  The only problem with this book for me is that it has no chapter demarcations.  Chapter demarcations make it so much easier to see how far along a person is in a book and how close a person is to the end of a chapter when he/she needs to find a stopping place at times.  Give it a shot because it might be just a bit of escapist fun for a while.  Have at it!

The chemistry between the main characters as well as the secondary ones is outstanding.When the story first starts Jordan and her partner / lover Gage are brutally attacked by a war demon and in the process the fatally injured Gage ends up dying in her arms.Fast forward five years into the future, Jordan is still a cop by day but by night she's an a** kicking demon slayer with an attitude! So imagine her anger and hurt when she discovers that Gage didn't really die that night. Instead he's stayed away for the last five years in a misguided attempt to protect her from the shadow demons that she hunts and slays every night.This book is definitely a keeper.

The first book I ever read to make a vampire the romantic lead, you kicked off a genre that has exploded and will not be stopped.  Truly groundbreaking, I thank you so much for leading the way and clearing a path for more.If you haven't read these books, DO SO NOW!A human can only become a vampire if they contain a rare blood antigen, and each vampire has one human with the antigen (a chosen) whom they feel drawn to protect.  A government agency, DPI (department of paranormal investigations), is out to capture and make lab rats out of every vampire possible and they're not above using The Chosen to do it.  And if they can't capture, they don't hesitate to kill.With this series, you get a complete story of two characters in each book, but we still get to reacquaint ourselves with some of our favorites along the way.Having read these books as a teenager, I was hesitant to reread them as an adult.  So many books that I loved back then fail to resonate with me now.  Wings in the night did not disappoint and I was enthralled once again.I truly believe that without this series, we would have no Twilight, no Midnight Breed, and no Blackdagger Brotherhood.  I'm not saying Wings In The Night inspired those books, I'm saying Wings In The Night created the genre and made it popular.","04 12, 2014",A1LWBT4OIUF49X,avidreader,"These books were the start of my obsession with ""good"" vampires.",1397260800

The other thing, I'm not sure how to put into words, but the author kept going on and on about the characters thoughts. For example, Jamison thought he disgusted Angelica. He kept going on and on and on and on and on and on and on (it's getting annoying isn't it?). Yeah! I ended up skipping sections when the characters did this.

There is a lot of heat and heart in Anticipation;it's a sexy and very romantic story.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","02 8, 2008",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Anticipation,1202428800

972,B000XZKZKM,"[3, 3]",5,"Eastern Texas, 1879At the age of five, Emma Radcliff made the monumental announcement that she is going to marry Rafe Sinclair.  She's done a lot of growing up in the fifteen years since then and has decided that she's not going to marry at all.  Wearing breeches and working horses on her father's ranch suits her just fine.  Only her plans are thwarted when her father insists that she marry Rafe - no if's, and's, or but's.Rafe Sinclair really has no interest in getting married but a stipulation in his grandfather's will forces the issue.  He has to be married by the time he turns thirty or he loses the Circle S Ranch.  Since he's known Emma her entire life she seems like a relatively safe choice but the last thing he anticipates is the little hellcat's insistence that he agree to stay out of her bed.  To make matters worse, little Emma is looking mighty gown up and he's just discovered that he wants her - in every way.Since Emma insists on her no sex clause, Rafe counters her with a clause of his own - that she reserves the right to change her mind and void her clause at any time.  Though still not entirely comfortable with the situation Emma agrees but also requests that she be allowed to work with the horses at the Triple R. They'll both have what they want - well almost.  Things don't go exactly according to plan.  Emma's father refuses to allow her to return to work the horses after the marriage takes place, she counterattacks with the insistence that she takes some of the horses with her.Rafe and Emma marry but no sooner are the vows spoken then the trouble starts.  Emma's always been very attracted to Rafe and Rafe is definitely finding it difficult to adhere to her `no marital privileges' clause.  What's a guy to do when he discovers that is new wife is the sexiest thing on two legs?  Well being a man of his word, he can't just grab her up and take her to his bed, he's going to have to seduce her.  Only Emma's just as stubborn as he is persuasive.  Which one will hold out the longest?Beth Williamson presents readers with yet another wonderful historical tale with her contribution to the LEATHER AND LACE series - BRANDED.  Emma won me over from the very first page.  She's so `in-your-face' and not afraid to go against convention that I couldn't wait to read all about her and find out how or even if Rafe can `tame' her.  Rafe grew up knowing Emma so of course he's never seen her in any sort of sexual way but he's seeing her now and practically salivating just thinking about bedding his own wife.  Ms. Williamson even throws in several supporting characters that you'll love to hate or hate to love, but in either case they're definitely unique and fun.Be sure to keep an eye out for the other LEATHER AND LACE series books.

Vowing at the tender age of five to marry him, she has had to live with the ridicule of that one statement until she has hardened her heart against Rafe.  When she finds out that her father has given his permission and signed a marriage contract between she and Rafe, Emma is hurt and angry.  She knows that deep down a man life Rafe could never love a woman like her so she sets out to negotiate her own marriage terms.Rafe Sinclair can't believe his grandfather put a stipulation to his inheritance.  If he doesn't marry by his birthday, the ranch on which he lives will no longer be his.  Having no choice but to find a wife, Rafe doesn't look forward to the politics that go along with wife hunting.  However, his problem is solved when Emma Radcliff's father and he agree on his marrying Emma.  Now if he can just get Emma to agree, his inheritance will be safe and Rafe will have a wife.Emma and Rafe have to learn to be a team.  Each is cantankerous in their own way, Emma more so in my opinion than Rafe.  She was so angry at times that even I winced at her displeasure.  I thought Rafe was loyal and hero worthy.  He was patient and kind to Emma and I wished more than once that she was a bit softer for this sexy virile man.  Beth Williamson came through for me with Emma's characterization because by the time I read the last word and closed Branded, I knew without a doubt that Emma was meant for Rafe and vice versa.Beth Williamson never fails to deliver a book that will keep me entertained and on the edge of my seat.  Her storyline of Branded was unique and I loved how it ended.  Nobody writes western historical romances like Beth Williamson and I am proud to be one of her biggest fans.","02 8, 2008",A1PW5SQLR0Z6IH,"Natalie S ""ns65""",Joyfully Reviewed!,1202428800

He loved her but did not know it, did not even know what love was...literally had no idea, and she loved him even when she did not want to. She left for about 5 months before he found her again. She was 8 months or so pregnant and the baby was 4 months old when he caught up to them. The heroine takes things for granted and should have talked to the hero when his assistant told her they were sleeping together, but she had insecurities that all pregnant women have and thought he wanted someone else. They were faithful during their time apart, which is always a plus to me. My favorite part is when she told him about how she had been proposed to before and that the waiter was going to propose tonight (to his own g/f, but she leaves that out to the hero) and he gets up and leaves, doesn't say anything, and comes back 30 minutes later with a ring.

There were some misunderstandings, that added to the suspense of the book. Anna was a strong Heroine. She had a backbone, and her pride. She came off all most too strong. It worked well in this story, because of how controlling Nikos was. He needed someone to stand up to him.Sample from chapter 2 - She felt the warmth of his breath. She could smell his skin, a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart, as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child. But Nikos was in no hurry. The seconds it took before his lips finally touched hers were exquisite torture. And when he finally kissed her the world seemed to whirl around them, making her dizzy, making her knees weak.","03 19, 2014",A2C8S6EB6MKYAX,Paula,Excellent book,1395187200
